What if classical composers such as Bach or Beethoven were transported into the latter 20th century and had to make a
living playing in modern "Classic rock and pop" bands? What sorts of band names might we see? Here are some of my suggestions:

<P>Alice Couperin
<BR>Electric Liszt Orchestra
<BR>Lynyrd Stryvynsky
<BR>Bach Sabbath
<BR>Gershwin, Lake, and Palmer
<BR>Scott and Janis Joplin
<BR>Van Haydn
<BR>Bruce Rubenstein
<BR>Schubertramp
<BR>Guns and Rossini
<BR>Mahlerillion
<BR>Harry Chopin
<BR>The Faure Seasons
<BR>Barbara Straussand
<BR>Jimi Handel Experience
<BR>The Griegful Dead
<BR>New Riders of the Purple Saint-Saens</P>
