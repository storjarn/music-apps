<H1>Obnoxious, surrealistic humor</H1>

<P>Can I help it if I like the Firesign Theatre, Monty Python, and the Marx Brothers? No,
I can't, and you can't change this fact either, so as far as I'm concerned you have only one of
two choices; laugh at this stuff or kill yourself. Don't be sending me irate, indignant email
telling me how insulted you are by it. (Do you actually think that someone who would put
together a Web Site like this would care about the opinions of folks who are insulted by this
stuff? Think about it). Besides, I can't differentiate between irate mail from the typical,
god-fearing republiclown and mail from a whip-snapping, severe dominatrix. They both
want to hurt me in the same places. So, you're just wasting your time (especially if you fall
into both catagories. I'm not into religious bondage, and have no desire to be tightly wrapped
in a leather Shroud of Turin).</P>
