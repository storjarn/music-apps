<P>What if Jim Croce had been born in Germany, lived during the second world war, and become a Nazi? His biggest
hit probably would have been a song entitled "Bad, Bad Eva Braun", and may have gone something like this:
<PRE>
Down the eastern side of Berlin, around 1939,
lived a gal by the name of Eva Braun with a face like my behind.

Well Eva was a terror with a heart as cold as ice.
And when she gave men a kiss with her prussian fist,
the feeling wasn't nice.

And she's bad, bad Eva Braun.
Baddest gal in the whole damn town.
Meaner than the whole SS.
And uglier than Rudolph Hess.

Now Eva met her boyfriend at a Nazi Disco dance.
With lots of pep, they did a fine goosestep
while their soldiers invaded France.

And Eva got to thinking that she'd like to have England too,
and every other state, she would annihilate
as she'd done with all them jews.

And she's bad, bad Eva Braun,
baddest gal in the whole damn town.
Meaner than Gengis Kahn,
and more explosive than an atom bomb.

But Eva didn't figure that Adolf was a wimp.
When the invasion hit, poor old Adolf shit
and the Reich came tumbling down.

Deep in a Berlin cellar, Eva's fate was met.
But her spirit will thrive 'cause it's kept alive
by Nazis on the Internet.

And she's bad, bad Eva Braun,
Baddest gal in the whole damn town.
Now she's in a pine box.
Still Rommel thinks she's a fox.
