Here's how you download and install MIDI Rexx. Since you don't need to reboot your computer nor log off the internet as you do the following, just follow the instructions step by step.

<OL>
<LI>First you need to install REXX. Don't worry about what this is now. The documentation will explain it later. So, <A HREF="../rexx/reginald/win32/reginald.exe">click upon this link to download REXX</A>. This should pop open a download dialog box that asks if you wish to run reginald.exe from its current location, or save to disk. Choose to run it from its current location.
</LI>

<P><LI>After REGINALD.EXE downloads, it will automatically walk you through the process of installing REXX. The first screen you see will list optional components, as so:

<P><CENTER><IMG src="rexx1.gif" WIDTH=412 HEIGHT=204></CENTER>

<P>Just click on <B>Next</B> to accept the default.
</LI>

<P><LI>A new screen will appear, asking where you would like to install the REXX files (not the desktop icons), as so:

<P><CENTER><IMG src="rexx2.gif" WIDTH=441 HEIGHT=162></CENTER>

<P>The directory shown above may be different than the one on your system. Just click on <B>Next</B> to accept the default.
</LI>

<P><LI>A new screen will appear, asking where you would like to install the icons for the REXX tools, as so:

<P><CENTER><IMG src="rexx3.gif" WIDTH=441 HEIGHT=160></CENTER>

<P>Above, a new folder will be created upon your desktop called "REXX", and inside of it will be icons to run the REXX tools. Just click on <B>Finish</B> to accept this. REXX will now be installed upon your system. If all goes well, you will see no message box indicating an error, and the REXX installation dialog will disappear. You will also see a "REXX" folder appear on your desktop.
</LI>

<P><LI>Now you need to install an add-on which allows your REXX software to create its own windows with menus, buttons, sliders, and all sorts of graphical controls. So, <A HREF="../rexx/win32/rexxgui.exe">click upon this link to download REXX GUI</A>. This should pop open a download dialog box that asks if you wish to run rexxgui.exe from its current location, or save to disk. Choose to run it from its current location.
</LI>

<P><LI>After REXXXGUI.EXE downloads, it will automatically walk you through the process of installing REXX GUI. The first screen you see is just an introduction. Click on <B>Finish</B> to install REXX GUI upon your system. If all goes well, you will see no message box indicating an error, and the REXX GUI installation dialog will disappear.
</LI>

<P><LI>Next, you need to install an add-on which allows your REXX software to deal with MIDI. So, <A HREF="../rexx/win32/rxmidi.exe">click upon this link to download MIDI Rexx</A>. This should pop open a download dialog box that asks if you wish to run rxmidi.exe from its current location, or save to disk. Choose to run it from its current location.
</LI>

<P><LI>After RXMIDI.EXE downloads, it will automatically walk you through the process of installing MIDI Rexx. The screens you see should be almost identical to REXX GUI, and so you simply have to repeat what you did above to finish the installation.
</LI>

<P><LI>Next, you must download and install the <A HREF="../midi/software/midifile.exe">MidiFile DLL</A> and <A HREF="../midi/software/genmidi.exe">GenMidi DLL</A>. These are very simple installation programs, and it's likely that you already have them on your system if you have used some of my other software.
</LI>

<P><LI>If you need to do simple, untimed (ie, not sequenced) MIDI input/output (and do not need to read/write/create MIDI files), then you may prefer to <A HREF="http://www.borg.com/~jglatt/rexx/win32/midirxio.exe">install MIDI IO</A> instead of MIDI Rexx. MIDI IO does not support creating/reading/writing MIDI files, nor does it offer sequencing features (timed playback and recording). But for simple input/output of MIDI data, it is easier to use.
</LI>

<P><LI>Next, you need to download a free text editor specially created for writing/debugging MIDI REXX software. It features a built-in debugger to run/debug your software, syntax color highlighting (ie, REXX keywords and function names, comments, etc, displayed in different colors), online help (ie, double-click on a REXX keyword or function name and press F1 to bring up a help page), and many other features.
So, <A HREF="../rexx/win32/rexxcntr.zip">click upon this link to download REXX Programmer Center</A>. This should pop open a download dialog box that asks if you wish to run rexxcntr.zip from its current location, or save to disk. Choose to save it to disk.

<P><LI>Now you need to install some online documentation (ie, a book) that explains all you need to know to create some software using REXX. So, <A HREF="../rexx/win32/rexxbook.zip">click upon this link to download the REXX book</A>. This should pop open a download dialog box that asks if you wish to run rexxbook.exe from its current location, or save to disk. Choose to save it to disk. Save it in the same place that you saved the REXXCNTR.ZIP file.
</LI>

</OL>

<P>Ok, you're done now. You can log off, and investigate the new REXX folder on your desktop. In particular, you'll find an icon named "Script Editor". Double-click on that. This will open a special text editor to write your software, and the REXX Language book will conveniently appear in a window right inside the text editor so you can learn as you're writing your first MIDI REXX program.

<P>After you start successfully writing some simple REXX scripts, then you're read the "MIDI Rexx" documentation (under "Sound -> MIDI), and learn how to deal with MIDI in your REXX software.

<P>Later, you'll probably want to read the "Graphical User Interface" docs to learn how to add a nice user interface to your software, so that it has a more professional look.

<P>Finally, you can email me back and tell me how you'd still rather surf nude to naughty web sites and order black lingerie.
