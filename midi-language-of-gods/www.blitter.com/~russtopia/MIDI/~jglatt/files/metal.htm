"overdriven guitar" sound out of a MIDI module. Check out how certain
notes in the guitar solo, being played by a distorted guitar patch, are

natural feedback that a guitarist would get, at certain points, if he were
playing with his amp turned up as loud as is done when playing this kind of
music.</BLOCKQUOTE>
