<BLOCKQUOTE>Big band. This has a very jazzy feel to it. Note how MIDI volume
and MOD controllers are used to add realism to the horn parts.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Big band. Although not written in the 40's, it could have been.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Big band. One of the most famous "jitterbug" tunes, recorded by Glenn
Miller. It's actually a simple blues progression. (Interestingly,
when the composer first presented this tune to Glenn Miller, he rejected it
as not being "hip enough". Popular tunes of late 30's were a bit more
substantial melodically and harmonically than a simple blues progression.
After a few years of prodding, the composer finally convinced Miller to give
it a go in 1941, and it became one of Miller's most popular numbers. Geez,
I'm starting to sound like that guy on "Arts and Entertainment" TV).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/standard/sanfran.zip">I Left my Heart in San Francisco</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bass, drums, piano, vibes. A slow ballad made famous by that MTV guy,
Tony Bennett. This arrangement has the introductory "verse" (before the
"I left my heart..." comes in), which a lot of musicians think is nicer
than the chorus which everyone knows. (Here on "A and E").</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>New orleans "jazz". Essentially, everyone just solos at once, in order
to make as much chaotic, uptempo noise as possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
