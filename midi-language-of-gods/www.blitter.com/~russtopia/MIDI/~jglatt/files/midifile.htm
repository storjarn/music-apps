Here are some MIDI files. I've chosen these particular files because
they are good demonstrations of particular arranging techniques
(especially in getting lifelike, "human" music out of MIDI gear), and/or
provide useful raw material (such as drum beats) for creating your own
MIDI arrangements. There are also files which contain useful system
exclusive dumps (such as a file that loads a Roland D-70 with a General MIDI
Patch Set and Drum Kit).

<P>I separated the various MIDI files by musical style (ie, Pop Rock,
Jazz, Orchestral, etc), or type where appropiate (ie, Drum Beats,
SysEx Data files), to minimize searching for what you want.</P>

<P><A HREF="pop.htm">Pop Rock</A>
<BR>Popular (ie, melodic) modern ballads or uptempo rock music.</P>

<P><A HREF="metal.htm">Heavy Metal</A>
<BR>Heavy metal (uptempo, guitar-emphasized, usually with distortion) rock music.</P>

<P><A HREF="orches.htm">Orchestral</A>
<BR>Orchestral arrangements (classical, or otherwise).</P>

<P><A HREF="prog.htm">Progressive Rock</A>
<BR>Musically sophisticated rock music, often influenced by western
classical or influences not often found in bland, popular music.
My favorite. Anyone got any "Henry Cow" MIDI files?</P>

<P><A HREF="classic.htm">Classical Small Ensemble</A>
<BR>Western classical music for solo instruments or small ensembles
(ie, chamber music).</P>

<P><A HREF="jazz.htm">Jazz</A>
<BR>More sophisticated than rock, but generally more freeform (ie,
improvised) and ultimately less complex compositionally than Progressive Rock.</P>

<P><A HREF="rnr.htm">1950's Rock and Roll</A>
<BR>Rock and Roll music from the 1950's. Usually simplistic, three chord
crap. I'm glad that I wasn't a teenager then.</P>

<P><A HREF="standard.htm">Standards</A>
<BR>Popular music circa 1930-1950, including Big Band arrangements.</P>

<P><A HREF="misc.htm">Miscellaneous</A>
<BR>Bluegrass, ethnic (ie, latin, polka), waltzes, marches, sound effects, etc.</P>

<P><A HREF="beats.htm">Drum Beats</A>
<BR>Drum beat (patterns) without any other instrumentation.</P>

<P><A HREF="data.htm">Data</A>
<BR>System Exclusive dumps or files that setup equipment using MIDI
controllers.</P>

<HR><P><H3>Additional Notes</H3></P>

<P>Below each song title is a short description, as well as remarks about
what I consider to be notable about the MIDI arrangement. I like to know
something about a MIDI file other than just its name.</P>

<P>These MIDI files have been zipped (ie, compressed) in order to reduce
storage space. After downloading, you must extract the MIDI file with an
"unzip" utility.</P>

<P>I've personally edited each MIDI file to ensure that it is fully General
MIDI compliant and has all of the MIDI controller messages needed to setup
a GM module to play the file properly.</P>

<P>This Web Site is limited by size, so I don't intend to put lots of MIDI
files here. There are other sites with many more files. What I'm aiming for
is a collection of well-arranged MIDI files that show a variety of musical
styles, so that a musician can get an idea of how to make his own arrangements
sound good on a MIDI module.</P>
