The following files consist only of drum beats. Each MIDI file (Type 1)
contains an entire drum arrangement (ie, intro, verses, choruses, with appropriate fills)
in a particular style (for example, Shuffle). These are arrangements that
I made myself, and I've strived to create arrangements that are typical of
what a gigging drummer would play, for a realistic performance that has
enough variation to sound human, but is subdued enough to provide suitable
rhythmic backup for any tune in that style. In order to make it easy to edit
the file, I've placed each drum sound (ie, kick, snare, cymbal, etc) upon
its own track. In accordance with General MIDI standard, all tracks play
notes on channel 10, and note/drum assignments are per <A HREF="http://www.borg.com/~jglatt/tutr/gm.htm%22">General MIDI</A>. So, if
you have a GM sound module, then just playback the MIDI file as is.

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/50s_slow.zip">1950's Ballad</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A swing (ie, triplet-based) ballad beat that would be
appropriate for slow (76 BPM) standards of the 1930's, 1940's, and especially
1950's. Typical songs might be "The Great Pretender", "Unchained Melody",
and "As Time Goes By".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/bigband.zip">Big Band Swing</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A swing beat that would be appropriate for uptempo (130 BPM)
"Big Band" jitterbugs of the 1930's and 1940's such as songs by Glenn Miller,
Benny Goodman, etc. Typical songs might be "Satin Doll", "All of Me", and
"String of Pearls". You'll want to play a "walking bass line" with this beat.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/chacha.zip">Cha Cha (Latin)</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Cha Cha (Latin) beat (110 BPM). Typical songs might be
"Spanish Eyes", "Quando Quando", and "Never on a Sunday". It can also be
used as a Rhumba.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/swingroc.zip">Swing Rock</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A swing rock beat that would be appropriate for uptempo (130
BPM) "Shuffle" tunes. You could use it as a more straight-forward swing beat
instead of "Big Band Swing", particularly for rather fast jitterbugs like "In the
Mood" or "Mac the Knife". It's primarily used for rock tunes that have a swing
feel such as "Rock Around the Clock" (192 BPM) or "Just a Gigolo" (124 BPM).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/ballad.zip">Modern Ballad</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A ballad beat that would be appropriate for slow (76 BPM)
modern songs written after 1960. Typical songs might be "Yesterday",
"The Way We Were", and Whitney Houston tunes such as "I Will Always Love You"
or "The Greatest Love of All".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/discoa.zip">Disco A</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A disco beat. Unlike Disco B, it doesn't have that kick drum on
every downbeat, so it has a less driving bottom end. On the other hand, it
has a more syncopated hihat part, which tends to compensate.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/discob.zip">Disco B</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The "standard" disco beat. Unlike Disco A, it has a kick drum on
every downbeat, so it has a more driving bottom end. The hihat is usually on
the offbeat, and in a later section, this is that often-used open hihat.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/latinroc.zip">Latin Rock</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A rock beat with a latin feel. What this means is that there
is a bit more syncopation than with a straight rock beat, particularly with
the hihat and kick. Also, there is some percussion mixed in, including Agogo
and maracas. A typical latin rock might be a Gloria Estefan (ie, Miami Sound
Machine) tune.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/rock.zip">Straight Rock</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A straight rock beat with hihat eighth notes. It could be used for
most any modern (non-swing) tune. You could even slow it down to 66 to 80 BPM
for a rock ballad.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/waltz.zip">Waltz</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A waltz (3/4) beat with a jazz feel. At 90 BPM, it can be used
for waltz standards such as "Somewhere My Love", "Let Me Call You Sweetheart",
and "Fascination". At 75 BPM, it could be used for a slow country waltz such
as "Could I Have This Dance" or "Tennesee Waltz".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/bossa.zip">Bossa Nova (Latin)</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Bossa Nova beat that would be appropriate for (110 BPM)
latin music, Typical songs might be "Girl from Ipanema" or "Tangerine".
Also, this beat can be used with ballads played with a latin feel such as
Billy Joel's "Just the Way You Are".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/polka.zip">Polka</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A fast (116 BPM) 4/4 beat that comes from Poland. You can almost
think of it as cut-time. Typical polkas are "Roll Out The Barrel", "In Heaven
There Is No Beer", and "Pennsylvania Polka". If you slow the tempo to 78 BPM,
you can use this for a Rhinelander dance.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/beats/gmdrum.mid">GM Drum Test</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This MIDI file contains a track that plays each drum note of a General MIDI
drum kit, one note at a time, in ascending order (starting with the Acoustic Bass Drum
and ending with the Open Triangle). Play this file to check the sounds in your GM drum
kit. A second track displays a lyric event for each drum sound, which gives the name
of the drum sound. If your sequencer can display lyrics during playback, then open a
Lyric window for the second track.</BLOCKQUOTE>
