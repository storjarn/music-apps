<BLOCKQUOTE>Bass, drums, piano, vibes, and trumpet. Typical "traditional jazz".

<BLOCKQUOTE>Bass, drums, piano, and brass ensemble. Bebop (ie, cut-time jazz).
Typical piano comp'ing, and drum part (ie, note use of brushes). The piano
solos, and then the brass plays some unison lines. The Applause patch
is used to simulate a live audience.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Bass, drums, marimba, piano, strings, and lots of brass. This has a samba
feel with lots of brass "hits" for accents. The piano solos, and the brass
plays a few quick lines in unison.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Chick Corea. Bass, drums, electronic keys. 1970/80's "electric jazz"
(ie, more experimental chord progressions and modal "excursions" than
"traditional jazz" uses). A synth solos in Chick's typical "Moog-inspired"
style.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Modern jazz with a latin feel.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/jazz/django.zip">Django</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Done in the style of Django Reinhart, a jazz guitarist. An acoustic guitar comps
in a jazz style while another guitar solos.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../midi/jazz/allblues.zip">All Blues</A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bass, drums, piano, saxes, solo trumpet. A very laid-back blues-jazz
improvisation. Nicely showcases using the muted trumpet patch for a solo.
Nice sax solo, too.</BLOCKQUOTE>
