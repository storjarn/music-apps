<P>Each RealTime Category message (ie, Status of 0xF8 to 0xFF) consists of only 1 byte, the Status. These messages are
primarily concerned with timing/syncing functions which means that they must be sent and received at specific times
without any delays. Because of this, MIDI allows a RealTime message to be sent <U>at any time</U>, even interspersed
within some other MIDI message. For example, a RealTime message could be sent inbetween the two data bytes of a
Note On message. A device should always be prepared to handle such a situation; processing the 1 byte RealTime
message, and then subsequently resume processing the previously interrupted message as if the RealTime message had
never occurred.
