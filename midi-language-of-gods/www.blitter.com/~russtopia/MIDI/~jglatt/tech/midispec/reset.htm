<P>The device receiving this should reset itself to a default state, usually the same state as when the device was turned
on. Often, this means to turn off all playing notes, turn the local keyboard on, clear running status, set Song Position to 0,
stop any timed playback (of a sequence), and perform any other standard setup unique to the device. Also, a device may
choose to kick itself into Omni On, Poly mode if it has no facilities for allowing the musician to store a default mode.

<P>A Reset message should never be sent automatically by any MIDI device. Rather, this should only be sent when a
musician specifically tells a device to do so.
