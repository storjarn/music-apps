MIDI (ie, Musical Instrument Digital Interface) consists of both a simple hardware interface, and a more elaborate transmission protocol.

<P>For a simple, layman's explanation of what MIDI is, read <A HREF="../../tutr/whatmidi.htm">What is MIDI?</A>

<P>The MIDI Specification is published by the MIDI Manufacturer's Association, ie, MMA (although this online
document gives you the same information for free, in easier-to-understand language, and in many cases, with even more
detail than the official document).
