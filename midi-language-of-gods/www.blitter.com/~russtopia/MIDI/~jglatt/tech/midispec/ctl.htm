<P>Sets a particular controller's value. A controller is any switch, slider, knob, etc, that implements some function (usually)
other than sounding or stopping notes (ie, which are the jobs of the Note On and Note Off messages respectively). There
are 128 possible controllers on a MIDI device. These are numbered from 0 to 127. Some of these controller numbers are
assigned to particular hardware controls on a MIDI device. For example, controller 1 is the <B>Modulation
Wheel</B>. Other controller numbers are free to be arbitrarily interpreted by a MIDI device. For example, a drum box
may have a slider controlling Tempo which it arbitrarily assigns to one of these free numbers. Then, when the drum box
receives a Controller message with that controller number, it can adjust its tempo. A MIDI device need not have an actual
physical control on it in order to respond to a particular controller. For example, even though a rack-mount sound module
may not have a <B>Mod Wheel</B> on it, the module will likely still respond to and utilize <B>Modulation controller</B>
messages to modify its sound. If the device is a MultiTimbral unit, then each one of its Parts may respond differently (or not
at all) to various controller numbers. The Part affected by a particular controller message is the one assigned to the
message's MIDI channel.

<P><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Status</FONT>
<P>0xB0 to 0xBF where the low nibble is the MIDI channel.

<P><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Data</FONT>
<P>Two data bytes follow the Status.

<P>The first data is the controller number (0 to 127). This indicates which controller is affected by the received MIDI
message.</P>

<P>The second data byte is the value to which the controller should be set, a value from 0 to 127.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Errata</FONT>
<P>An <A HREF="ntnoff.htm">All Controllers Off</A> controller message can be used to reset all controllers (that a
MIDI device implements) to default values. For example, the <B>Mod Wheel</B> is reset to its "off"
position upon receipt of this message.

<P>See the list of <A HREF="ctllist.htm">Defined Controller Numbers</A> for more information about particular
controllers.
