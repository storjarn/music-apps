Universal SysEx messages are SysEx messages that are not for any one particular manufacturer, but
rather, meant to be utilized by all manufacturer's products. For example, many manufacturers
make digital samplers. It became desirable for manufacturers to allow exchange of waveform data
between each others' products. So, a standard protocol was developed called <B>MIDI Sample Dump
Standard</B> (SDS). Of course, since waveforms typically entail large amounts of data, SysEx
messages (ie, containing over a hundred bytes each) were chosen as the most suitable vehicle to
transmit the data over MIDI. But, it was decided not to use a particular manufacturer's ID for
these SysEx messages. So, a universal ID was created.

There are actually 2 IDs dedicated to Universal SysEx messages. There's a universal ID meant
for realtime messages (ie, ones that need to be responded to immediately), and one for
non-realtime (ie, ones which can be processed when the device gets around to it). Here are
those ID numbers:

<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=BLUE>RealTime ID	    0x7F
Non-RealTime ID  0x7E
</B></FONT></PRE>

<P>No particular manufacturer is ever assigned an ID consisting of the single byte 0x7F or
0x7E. These are reserved for Universal SysEx messages adopted by the MMA.

<P>A general template for these two IDs was defined. After the ID byte is a
<B><I>SysEx Channel</I></B> byte. This could be from 0 to 127 for a total of 128 SysEx channels.
So, although "normal" SysEx messages have no MIDI channel like Voice Category messages do, a
Universal SysEx message can be sent on one of 128 SysEx channels. This allows the musician
to set various devices to ignore certain Universal SysEx messages (ie, if the device allows the
musician to set its Base SysEx Channel. Most devices just set their Base Sysex channel to the
same number as the Base Channel for Voice Category messages). On the other hand, a SysEx channel
of 127 is actually meant to tell the device to "disregard the channel and pay attention to this
message regardless".

<P>After the SysEx channel, the next two bytes are <B>Sub IDs</B> which tell
what the SysEx is for. There are several Sub IDs defined for particular messages. There is a Sub ID for a Universal
SysEx message to set a device's master volume. (This is different than Volume controller which
sets the volume for only one particular MIDI channel). There is a Sub ID for a Universal
SysEx message to set a device's Pitch Wheel bend range. There are a couple of Sub IDs for 
some Universal SysEx messages to implement a waveform (sample) dump over MIDI. Etc.

<P>The next sections of this online book document the defined Universal SysEx messages.
