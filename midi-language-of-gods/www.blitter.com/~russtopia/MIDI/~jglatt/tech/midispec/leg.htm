<P><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Affects:</FONT></B>
<P>When on, this causes a legato effect between notes, which is usually
achieved by skipping the attack portion of the VCA's envelope. Use of this
controller allows a keyboard player to better simulate the phrasing of
wind and brass players, who often play several notes with a single tonguing,
or simulate guitar pull-offs and hammer-ons (ie, where secondary notes
are not picked). If a MultiTimbral device, then each Part usually has its
own Legato Pedal setting.
