<P>Some master device that controls sequence playback sends this message to make a slave device start playback of
some song/sequence from the beginning (ie, MIDI Beat 0).

<P>A MIDI Start always begins playback at MIDI Beat 0 (ie, the very beginning of the song).  So, when a slave device
receives a MIDI Start, it automatically resets its "Song Position" to 0. If the device needs to start playback at some other
point (either set by a previous Song Position Pointer message, or manually by the musician), then MIDI Continue
is used instead of MIDI Start.

<P>Often, the slave device has its playback tempo synced to the master via MIDI Clock. See
<A HREF="seq.htm">Syncing Sequence Playback</A>.
