<P><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Purpose</FONT>
<P>Some master device that controls sequence playback sends this timing message to keep a slave device in sync with the
master. A MIDI Tick message is sent at regular intervals of one message every 10 milliseconds.

<P><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Errata</FONT>
<P>While a master device's "clock" is playing back, it will send a continuous stream of MIDI Tick events at a
 rate of one per every 10 milliseconds.

<P>A slave device might receive (from a master device) a Song Select message to cue a specific song to play (out of several songs), a Song Position
Pointer message to cue that song to start on a particular beat, a MIDI Continue in order to start playback from that beat,
periodic MIDI Ticks in order to keep the playback in sync with the master, and eventually a MIDI Stop to halt
playback. See <A HREF="seq.htm">Syncing Sequence Playback</A>.
