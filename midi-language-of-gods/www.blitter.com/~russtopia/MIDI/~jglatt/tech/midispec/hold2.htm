<P>When on, this lengthens the release time of the playing notes' VCA (ie, makes the note take longer to fade out after it's
released, versus when this pedal is off). Unlike the other <A HREF="hold.htm">Hold Pedal</A> controller, this pedal doesn't permanently
sustain the note's sound until the musician releases the pedal. Even though the note takes longer to fade out when this
pedal is on, the note may eventually fade out despite the musician still holding down the key <U>and</U> this pedal. If a
MultiTimbral device, then each Part usually has its own Hold 2 Pedal setting.
