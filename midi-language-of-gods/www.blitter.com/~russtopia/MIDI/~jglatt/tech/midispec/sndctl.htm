<P>These 5 controllers can be used to adjust any parameters associated with
the circuitry that produces sound. For example, if a device uses looped
digital waveforms to create sound, one controller may adjust the sample
rate (ie, playback speed), for a "tuning" control. If a MultiTimbral device,
then each Part usually has its own patch with its respective VCA, VCF,
tuning, sound sources, etc, parameters that can be adjusted with these
controllers.

<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>Note:</FONT></B> There are other controllers for adjusting VCA attack and
release times, and VCF cutoff frequency. These controllers would be used to adjust sound
parameters for which there are not already other, defined controllers.

<P>0 to 127, with 0 being minimum setting.
