<P>You'll note that we use only one byte for the Manufacturer ID. And since a midi data byte can't
be greater than 0x7F, that means we have only 127 IDs to dole out to manufacturers. Well, there
are more than 127 manufacturers of MIDI products.

<P>To accomodate a greater range of manufacturer IDs, the MMA decided to reserve a manufacturer
ID of 0 for a special purpose. When you see a manufacturer ID of 0, then there will be two
more data bytes after this. These two data bytes combine to make the real manufacturer ID. So,
some manufacturers have IDs that are 3 bytes, where the first byte is always 0. Using this
"trick", the range of unique manufacturer IDs is extended to accomodate over 16,000 MIDI
manufacturers.

<P>For example, Microsoft's manufacturer ID consists of the 3 bytes 0x00 0x00 0x41.
Note that the first byte is 0 to indicate that the real ID is 0x0041, but is still different
than Roland's ID which is only the single byte of 0x41.

<P>A manufacturer must get a registered ID from the MMA if he wants to define his own SysEx
messages, or use the following:

<PRE><B><FONT SIZE=3 COLOR=BLUE>Educational Use  0x7D
</B></FONT></PRE>

This ID is for educational or development use only, and should never appear in a commercial design.

<P>On the other hand, it is permissible to use another manufacturer's defined SysEx message(s) in
your own products. For example, if the Roland S-770 has a particular SysEx message that you could
use verbatim in your own design, you're free to use that message (and therefore the Roland ID in
it). But, you're not allowed to transmit a mutated version of any Roland message with a Roland ID.
Only Roland can develop new messages that contain a Roland ID.
