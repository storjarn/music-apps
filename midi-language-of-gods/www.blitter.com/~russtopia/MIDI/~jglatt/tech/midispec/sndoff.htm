<P><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Affects:</FONT></B>
<P>Mutes all sounding notes that were turned on by received Note On messages, and which haven't yet been turned off by
respective Note Off messages. This message is not supposed to mute any notes that the musician is playing on the local
keyboard. So, if a device can't distinguish between notes played via its <B>MIDI IN</B> and notes played on the local
keyboard, it should not implement All Sound Off.

<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>Note:</FONT></B> The difference between this message and <A HREF="ntnoff.htm">All Notes Off</A>
is that this message immediately mutes all sound on the device regardless of whether the <A HREF="hold.htm">Hold Pedal</A>
is on, and mutes the sound quickly regardless of any lengthy VCA release times. It's often used by sequencers to quickly
mute all sound when the musician presses "Stop" in the middle of a song.

<P>The value byte isn't used and defaults to 0.
