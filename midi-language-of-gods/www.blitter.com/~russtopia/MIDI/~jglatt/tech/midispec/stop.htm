song/sequence.

<P>When a device receives a MIDI Stop, it should keep track of the point at which it stopped playback (ie, its stopped
"Song Position"), in the anticipation that a MIDI Continue might be received next.

<P>Often, the slave device has its playback tempo synced to the master via MIDI Clock. See
<A HREF="seq.htm">Syncing Sequence Playback</A>.
