<P>Some MIDI devices have more than 128 Programs (ie, Patches, Instruments, Preset, etc). A MIDI Program
Change message supports switching between only 128 programs. So, Bank Select Controller (sometimes
called Bank Switch) is sometimes used to allow switching between groups of 128 programs. For example, let's
say that a device has 512 Programs. It may divide these into 4 banks of 128 programs apiece.  So, if you
want program #129, that would actually be the first program within the second bank. You would send a Bank
Select Controller to switch to the second bank, and then follow with a Program Change to select the first
Program in this bank. If a MultiTimbral device, then each Part usually can be set to its own Bank/Program.

<P>On MultiTimbral devices that have a Drum Part, the Bank Select is sometimes used to switch between
"Drum Kits".

<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>Note:</FONT></B> When a Bank Select is received, the MIDI module doesn't actually
change to a patch in the new bank. Rather, the Bank Select value is simply stored by the MIDI module without
changing the current patch. Whenever a subsequent Program Change is received, the stored Bank Select is
<U>then</U> utilized to switch to the specified patch in the new bank. For this reason, Bank Select must be
sent <U>before</U> a Program Change, when you desire changing to a patch in a different bank. (Of course, if
you simply wish to change to another patch in the same bank, there is no need to send a Bank Select first).

<P><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Value Range:</FONT></B>
<P>14-bit coarse/fine resolution. 0x0000 to 0x3FFF. Various manufacturers may number their banks differently.
Consult the documentation for a MIDI device to determine what values to use with the Bank Select Coarse and
Bank Select Fine messages to select particular banks.

<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>Note:</FONT></B> Most devices use the Coarse adjust (#0) alone to switch
banks since most devices don't have more than 128 banks (of 128 Patches each).
