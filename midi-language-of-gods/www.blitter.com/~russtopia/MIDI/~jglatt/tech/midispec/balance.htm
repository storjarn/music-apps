<P>The device's stereo balance (assuming that the device has stereo audio outputs). If a MultiTimbral device, then each
Part usually has its own Balance. This is generally when Balance becomes useful, because then you can use Pan, Volume,
and Balance controllers to internally mix all of the Parts to the device's stereo outputs. Typically, Balance would be used
on a Part that had stereo elements (where you wish to adjust the volume of the stereo elements without changing their pan
positions), whereas <A HREF="pan.htm">Pan</A> is more appropriate for a Part that is strictly a "mono instrument".

<P>14-bit coarse/fine resolution. 16,384 possible setting, 0x0000 to 0x3FFF where 0x2000 is center balance, 0x0000
emphasizes the left elements mostly, and 0x3FFF emphasizes the right elements mostly. Some devices only respond to
coarse adjust (128 settings) where 64 is center, 0 is leftmost emphsis, and 127 is rightmost emphasis.

<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>Note:</FONT></B> Most all devices ignore the Fine adjust (#40) for Balance, and just implement Coarse adjust (#8) because 14-bit
resolution isn't needed for this.
