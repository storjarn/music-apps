<P><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Purpose</FONT>
<P>Some master device that controls sequence playback sends this message to force a slave device to set a certain song
for playback (ie, sequencing).

<P><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Status</FONT>
<P>0xF3

<P><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Data</FONT>
<P>One data byte follows the status. It's the song number, a value from 0 to 127.

<P><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Errata</FONT>
<P>Most devices display "song numbers" starting from 1 instead of 0. Some devices even use different labeling systems
for songs, ie, bank 1, number 1 song. But, a Song Select message with song number 0 should always select the first song.

<P>When a device receives a Song Select message, it should cue the new song at MIDI Beat 0 (ie, the very beginning of the
song), unless a subsequent Song Position Pointer message is received for a different MIDI Beat. In other words, the device
resets its "Song Position" to 0.

<P>Often, the slave device has its playback tempo synced to the master via MIDI Clock. See
<A HREF="seq.htm">Syncing Sequence Playback</A>.
