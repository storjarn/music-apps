<P><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Number:</FONT></B> 123

<P><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Affects:</FONT></B>
<P>Turns off all notes that were turned on by received Note On messages, and which haven't yet been turned off by
respective Note Off messages. This message is not supposed to turn off any notes that the musician is playing on the
local keyboard. So, if a device can't distinguish between notes played via its <B>MIDI IN</B> and notes played on the
local keyboard, it should not implement All Notes Off. Furthermore, if a device is in Omni On state, it should
ignore this message on <U>any</U> channel.

<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>Note:</FONT></B> If the device's <A HREF="hold.htm">Hold Pedal</A> controller
is on, the notes aren't actually released until the Hold Pedal is turned off. See
<A HREF="sndoff.htm">All Sound Off</A> controller message for turning off the sound of these notes
immediately.

<P><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Value Range:</FONT></B>
<P>The value byte isn't used and defaults to 0.
