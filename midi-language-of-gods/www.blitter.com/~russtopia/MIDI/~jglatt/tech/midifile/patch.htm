<P>The name of the program (ie, patch) used to play the MTrk. This may be
different than the Sequence/Track Name. For example, maybe the name of your sequence (ie, Mtrk)
is "Butterfly", but since the track is played upon an electric piano patch, you may also include a
Program Name of "ELECTRIC PIANO".

<P>Usually, the instruments (ie, patches, tones, banks, etc) are setup on the audio devices via
<B>MIDI Program Change</B> and <B>MIDI Bank Select Controller</B> events within the MTrk. So,
this event exists merely to provide the user with visual feedback of what particular patch is
used for a track. But it can also give a hint to intelligent software if patch remapping needs
to be done. For example, if the MIDI file was created on a non-General MIDI instrument, then
the <B>MIDI Program Change</B> event will likely contain the
wrong value when played on a General MIDI instrument. Intelligent software can use the
Program Name event to look up the correct value for the <B>MIDI Program Change</B> event.

<P>Note that <I><FONT COLOR=GREEN><B>len</B></FONT></I> could be a series of bytes since it
is expressed as a variable length quantity.
