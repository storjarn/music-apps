<P>Any amount of text (amount of bytes = <I><FONT COLOR=GREEN><B>len</B></FONT></I>) for any
purpose. It's best to put this event at the beginning of an MTrk. Although this text could be
used for any purpose, there are other text-based Meta-Events for such things as orchestration,
lyrics, track name, etc. This event is primarily used to add "comments" to a MIDI file which a
program would be expected to ignore when loading that file.

<P>Note that <I><FONT COLOR=GREEN><B>len</B></FONT></I> could be a series of bytes since it
is expressed as a variable length quantity.
