Data is always saved within a <B>chunk</B>. There can be many chunks inside of a MIDI file.

<P>Each chunk can be a different size (and likely will be). A chunk's size is how many (8-bit)
bytes are contained in the chunk.

<P>The data bytes in a chunk are typically related in some way. For example, all of the bytes in one chunk
may be for one particular sequencer track. The bytes for another sequencer track may be put in
a different chunk. So, a chunk is simply a group of related bytes.

<P>Each chunk must begin with a 4 character (ie, 4 ascii bytes) <B>ID</B> which tells what "type"
of chunk this is.

<P>The next 4 bytes must form a 32-bit length (ie, size) of the chunk.

<P><U>All chunks must begin with these two fields</U> (ie, 8 bytes), which are referred to as the
<B>chunk header</B>.

<P>Here's what a chunk's header looks like if you defined it in C:

<PRE><FONT SIZE=3><B><FONT COLOR=BLUE>struct</FONT> CHUNK_HEADER
{
   <FONT COLOR=BLUE>char</FONT>           ID[4];
   <FONT COLOR=BLUE>unsigned long</FONT>  Length; 
};</B></FONT></PRE>

<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>NOTE:</FONT></B> The <B>Length</B> does not include the 8 byte chunk
header. It simply tells you how many bytes of data are in the chunk <U>following this header</U>.

<P>And here's an example chunk header (with bytes expressed in hex) if you examined it with a hex editor:

<P>4D 54 68 64 00 00 00 06

<P>Note that the first 4 bytes make up the ascii ID of <B>MThd</B> (ie, the first four
bytes are the ascii values for 'M', 'T', 'h', and 'd'). The next 4 bytes tell us that there should
be 6 more data bytes in the chunk (and after that we should find the next chunk header or the end
of the file).

<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>NOTE:</FONT></B> The 4 bytes that make up the <B>Length</B> are stored in (Motorola) "Big Endian"
byte order, not (Intel) "Little Endian" reverse byte order. (ie, The 06 is the fourth byte instead
of the first of the four).

<P>In fact, all MIDI files begin with the above <B>MThd header</B> (and that's how you know that it's
a MIDI file).
