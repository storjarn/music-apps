<P>Time signature is expressed as 4 numbers. <I><FONT COLOR=RED><B>nn</B></FONT></I>
and <I><FONT COLOR=RED><B>dd</B></FONT></I> represent the
"numerator" and "denominator" of the signature as notated on sheet music. The denominator is a
negative power of 2: 2 = quarter note, 3 = eighth, etc.

<P>The <I><FONT COLOR=RED><B>cc</B></FONT></I> expresses the number of
MIDI clocks in a metronome click.

<P>The <I><FONT COLOR=RED><B>bb</B></FONT></I> parameter expresses the number of notated
32nd notes in a MIDI quarter note (24 MIDI clocks). This event allows a program to relate what
MIDI thinks of as a quarter, to something entirely different.

<P>For example, 6/8 time with a
metronome click every 3 eighth notes and 24 clocks per quarter note would be the following
event:

<P>FF 58 04 06 03 18 08

<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>NOTE:</FONT></B> If there are no time signature events in a MIDI file,
then the time signature is assumed to be 4/4.

<P>In a format 0 file, the time signatures changes are scattered throughout the one
MTrk. In format 1, the very first MTrk should consist of only the time signature (and tempo) events
so that it could be read by some device capable of generating a "tempo map". It is best not to
place MIDI events in this MTrk. In format 2, each
MTrk should begin with at least one initial time signature (and tempo) event.
