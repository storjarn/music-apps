To illustrate how best to use various Meta-Events when you save a MIDI file, let's consider
an example sequencer track.

<P>Assume that the user has created a sequencer track that he named "My track". He is
using a Roland JV-1080 to play this track. His JV-1080 is connected to the third MIDI Out port on
his computer's MIDI interface (which supports multiple MIDI Outs -- for more than 16 MIDI
channels). The operating system lists this port with a name of "MIDI Out 3". He
has picked out a patch on his JV-1080 called "Gonzo Harp". This is not a General MIDI patch. It happens
to be in the third bank of patches, and is patch number 0. This track will play on the JV-1080's
MIDI channel 1.

<P>How would you write out an MTrk for this sequencer track?

<P>First, you would start off with a <A HREF="trkname.htm" TARGET=Frame2>Sequence/Track Name</A>
Meta-Event. The text for this event would be "My track". (Note that you do not need to nul-terminate
text in a Meta-Event. The Meta-Event's variable quantity length tells how many characters are in
the name). You would put this at a delta-time of zero. So let's examine our MTrk chunk so far,
as if we were using a hex editor:

</B></PRE>

Next, you may choose to put an <A HREF="instrum.htm" TARGET=Frame2>Instrument Name</A>
Meta-Event (although this isn't as important as other events, and you may skip it if your
software neither knows, nor cares, what specific MIDI module is playing the track). The text for
this event would be "Roland JV-1080".

Next, you would put a <A HREF="port.htm" TARGET=Frame2>Device (Port) Name</A>
Meta-Event. The text for this event would be "MIDI Out 3".

Next, you would put an <A HREF="patch.htm" TARGET=Frame2>Program (Patch) Name</A>
Meta-Event to indicate the name of the patch being used. The text for this event would
be "Gonzo Harp".

Next, you need to put the MIDI Bank Select Controller events and the MIDI Program Change
event that select the desired patch ("Gonzo Harp") on the JV-1080. Let's assume that the Bank
Select values will be 0 for MSB controller and 3 for LSB. We already said that the patch
number is 0.

</B></PRE>

<P>After this, you would put other data for the track, such as MIDI Note-on, Note-off, etc, and
other Meta-Events.

<HR>

<P>Now let's examine loading that same file created above.

<P>First, you'll encounter the Track Name event. Use this to set the name for the sequencer
track which will store this MTrk's data.

<P>Next, you'll encounter the Instrument Name. If your program keeps a database of instruments
that are "installed" on the computer, this could come in useful for several reasons. First,
if your database lists which instruments are attached to which MIDI ports on the system, then
you could ignore any Device (Port) Name event (just in case it happens to refer to someone else's
MIDI port that isn't applicable on your system). You'll know which MIDI port to use for
this MTrk based solely upon the Instrument Name and your own database. Secondly, if you have
that instrument listed in your database, then you choose to forego any patch remapping. (ie,
You may choose not to check that the values in any Bank Select and Program Change messages
are correct, under the assumption that the desired patch is already located where it should be).
At least, it may make any patch remapping easier.

<P>Next, you'll encounter the Device (Port) Name event. If you weren't able to use the
Instrument Name to deduce which MIDI port to use on your system, then you should check this
port name. If it exists on your system, use that port. If not, use a default port.

<P>Next, you'll encounter the Program Name event. You can use this to implement patch remapping.
If your instrument database also lists what patches are available upon each
instrument, then you can check for the existence of this patch in your database. (If you were able
to use the Instrument Name, then you already know upon what instrument that patch should be
found). Once you find that patch in your database, hopefully your database will contain the
correct Bank Select and Program Change values needed to select that patch. In that case, you
could ignore the next Bank Select and Program Change events you encounter in the MTrk. What you've
effectively done is remap a patch change. So for example, if the MTrk was created upon an
instrument with a unique arrangement of patches (and therefore its Bank Select and Program Change
events have the wrong values when played upon a different instrument), you've remapped it to play
the correct patch on another instrument.

<P>Finally, you'll encounter the Bank Select and Program Change events. If you weren't able to
use the Instrument and Program Name Meta-Events to deduce the correct Bank Select and Program
Change values, then you may use these events verbatim.

A free Dynamic Link Library called "GenMidi" is available to programmers writing MIDI software.
This DLL can be used to maintain a database of Instrument names, and the names of all patches on
those instruments (including which Bank Select and Program Change values select each patch). Included
with the DLL is a tool that allows a user to create a database of such.

<P>By using this DLL in your program, you can more easily implement patch remapping, and better
coordinate with other programs that also use this DLL. Plus, you don't have to develop your own
tools to allow users to create such databases.

<P>The DLL is downloadable from the <A HREF="../../progs/software.htm">Software Programs</A> page.
