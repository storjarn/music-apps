<P>FF 00 00

<P>This optional event must occur at the beginning of a MTrk (ie, before any non-zero
delta-times and before any midi events). It specifies the sequence number. The two data bytes
<I><FONT COLOR=RED><B>ss ss</B></FONT></I>, are that number which corresponds to the <B>MIDI
Cue</B> message. In a format 2 MIDI file, this number identifies each "pattern" (ie, Mtrk) so
that a "song" sequence can use the MIDI Cue message to refer to patterns.

<P>If the <I><FONT COLOR=RED><B>ss ss</B></FONT></I> numbers are omitted (ie, the second form
shown above), then the MTrk's location in the file is used. (ie, The first MTrk chunk is
sequence number 0. The second MTrk is sequence number 1. Etc).

<P>In format 0 or 1, which contain only one "pattern" (even though format 1 contains
several MTrks), this event is placed in only the first MTrk. So, a group of format 0 or 1 files
with different sequence numbers can comprise a "song collection".

<P>There can be only one of these events per MTrk chunk in a Format 2. There can be only one
of these events in a Format 0 or 1, and it must be in the first MTrk.
