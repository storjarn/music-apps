<P>Indicates a tempo change. The 3 data bytes of <B>tt tt tt</B> are the tempo in microseconds per quarter note. In other
words, the microsecond tempo value tells you how long each one of your sequencer's "quarter notes" should be. For example,
if you have the 3 bytes of 07 A1 20, then each quarter note should be 0x07A120 (or 500,000) microseconds long.

<P>So, the MIDI file format expresses tempo as "the amount of time (ie, microseconds) per quarter note".

<P><B><FONT COLOR=RED>NOTE:</FONT></B> If there are no tempo events in a MIDI file, then the
tempo is assumed to be 120 BPM

<P>In a format 0 file, the tempo changes are scattered throughout the one
MTrk. In format 1, the very first MTrk should consist of only the tempo (and time signature) events
so that it could be read by some device capable of generating a "tempo map". It is best not to
place MIDI events in this MTrk. In format 2, each
MTrk should begin with at least one initial tempo (and time signature) event.
