MIDI mostly came about because keyboard players were buying synthesizers
in increasing numbers from many different manufacturers, and they wanted
to "sync" those various keyboards together, plus "play" them under
"computer control" (since computer use was also increasing dramatically
during that time). Companies were making analog sequencers, but each
company's sequencer worked only with its own products. (See the article
<A href="olddays.htm">The historical significance of computers/MIDI</A>
for more explanation about what musicians wanted to do, and what
problems they were facing back then). For example, Sequential Circuits
made an analog sequencer that attached to a proprietary jack on the
Prophet 5, and could be used to program the playback of a short phrase,
but it wouldn't work on a Roland D-10 or Oberheim OBX-8 synth. And
during the early 1980's, a lot of "pop dance music" was using sequenced
phrases played on synths.

<P>Two of the leading musical manufacturers back then were a California
company called Sequential Circuits (who were making the best-selling
synthesizer at the time -- early 1980's -- called the Prophet 5) and
Roland, a japanese company who had been making popular musical keyboards
for awhile, and were at the forefront of making musical interfaces for
computers.

<P>Indeed, Roland was one of the first companies to start making musical
products that attached to computers. At the time, IBM had just released
its first personal computer, the IBM PC, which gave a "serious
endorsement" to personal computers. Also, Commodore had released the
Commodore 64, one of the first really affordable "home computers", and
sales were really starting to take off with personal computers. The
Commodore 64 had a built-in analog synthesizer chip made by a musical
company called Ensoniq. It wasn't very fancy, but nonetheless, musicians
started playing around with it, and quickly began to discover that the
programmability of digital computers, combined with a musical
instrument, offered them a lot of potential solutions to those problems
they were having back then.

<P>Roland saw the potential musical use that computers offered. So
Roland began work on a musical interface for the IBM PC. (Unlike the
C-64, the IBM PC had no "fancy" built-in sound chip, so there was a void
to be filled with a third party product). Roland envisioned a "digital
sequencer" to replace the analog sequencers of the time, and it would be
built around an IBM PC, which offered a lot of
programmability/versatility using tools made by many other companies. Of
course, since the PC had no built-in sound chip, and also, Roland wanted
this digital sequencer to be able to work with Roland's entire line of
new keyboards, Roland decided to build a hardware "musical interface"
for the PC. Roland chose to make this an ISA card that plugged into one
of the slots of an AT style IBM PC computer, to which an external box
was attached that contained further circuitry. It had a lot of
intelligent electronics in it, which primarily were designed to add
features that turned a computer into a versatile sequencer. For example,
it had a built-in metronome and also a tape sync jack so that the
computer playback could be synced to a magnetic analog tape recorder
such as a reel-to-reel or cassette recorder. It had built-in hardware
timers to control the playback, and some filtering options of the
digital data flowing between the computer and an external musical
instrument. In designing this proprietary PC musical interface, Roland
came up with a simple hardware circuit, and a fancy new, "digital
language" that they planned to use with all of their upcoming musical
keyboards. This digital language would allow the computer and musical
instruments to transfer "control data" between them. This new interface
would be known as a "Musical Instrument Digital Interface" or MIDI.
(Roland loves anacronyms). And the PC card itself would become the
MPU-401 ("Musical Processing Unit, model 401" -- gotta love those
anacronyms), the first MIDI interface for a computer. (To this day, the
MIDI interfaces built into some modern sound cards still offer hardware
compatibility to the original MPU-401 since it became such a widely used
MIDI interface for a computer).

<P>Roland and Sequential Circuit representatives used to see each other
at NAMM (a business trade show for the music industry), and were talking
about how customers were wishing that they had some sequencer that
worked with the keyboards from all manufacturers. And Roland said, "You
know, we're working on this new peripheral for the IBM PC to turn it
into a musical sequencer, using a hardware/software protocol in all of
our upcoming keyboards. Would you be interested in supporting this? We
could both benefit from it since you make such a popular synth, and
we'll be making a musical sequencer for these increasingly popular
personal computers". The SQ reps said "Sure. We've got some ideas of our
own that we're adding to upcoming synths. Maybe we can incorporate these
into one standard between us". So Roland sent some design specs to the
SQ guys, who made some suggested changes and additions. They both
decided to go ahead and adopt this "standard". Then they thought, "Why
not see if we can get some of the other leading musical manufacturers to
adopt it, as long as it's not really a proprietary standard anymore?".
So, they contacted other popular musical manufacturers such as Yamaha
and Oberheim, and got them onboard too. MIDI was perhaps the first true
effort at joint development among a large number of musical manufacturers.

<P>The first keyboard on the market with a MIDI interface was the
Prophet 600 by Sequential Circuits in 1983. Of course, the Roland
MPU-401 appeared shortly thereafter with some PC software from Roland
that turned the PC into a musical sequencer. Roland made some MPU-401
programming information available to other parties, and soon, there were
other PC programs that supported the MPU-401 interface. (Indeed, those
other programs proved to be more popular than Roland's initial MESA
software. One of those products was called "Cakewalk", made by a small
upstart known as "12 Tone Systems", who later changed their name to
"Cakewalk" since that product became synonymous with the company). New
Roland keyboards also sported a MIDI interface. Yamaha released the DX-7
later that same year, their first keyboard with a MIDI interface. The
DX-7 proved to be a huge hit with musicians. They loved the sound of its
new, "FM synthesis", bought it in droves, and started to fool around
with this new "MIDI interface" thing. Apple computer made a MIDI
interface available for its Macintosh computer, and started promoting
the computer in the music market during the mid-to-late 1980's since
that was a market completely ignored by their biggest competitor IBM,
and one that offered them many potential sales, being that musicians
loved the flexibility and ease of use of the new, computer-based
"digital sequencers". MIDI took off then. By 1985, virtually every new
musical keyboard on the market had a MIDI interface.

<P>Roland and SQ thought "Well, we don't want to be responsible for
disseminating new additions to MIDI to every music/computer company that
supports MIDI. We have too much other work to do. We don't have the time
to prepare and mail documents to everyone else". So, all of the musical
manufacturers supporting MIDI agreed to start a new organization called
the MIDI Manufacturer's Association (ie, MMA). It would be the duty of
this new organization to produce/disseminate the paper documents for the
MIDI standard, and be the clearing house for new additions/changes to
the specification. Members of the MMA would pay some dues to fund the
cost of operating this new organization. (Dues were $50 a year, as I
recall). And thus, the MMA was born.

<P>It was through the MMA that new additions to the MIDI specification
were channeled. For example, Opcode offered the MIDI File Format
specification to the MMA, and thus, everyone started creating MIDI
sequencer software that could read/write each others' data files. (Prior
to that, each sequencer program had its own proprietary file format, and
couldn't read each others' data files). Digidesign offered MIDI Time
Code (MTC), and thus a standard was created for syncing the playback of
various sequencers. (Prior to that, most sequencers also had proprietary
sync protocols, for example, a whole mess of incompatible FSK sync
interfaces).

<P>In recent years, the MMA hasn't been doing much of anything except
for selling photocopies of specifications that were written years ago,
and some people have almost forgotten that it even exists. Consequently,
there have been very few changes/additions to MIDI for about the past 5
to 10 years. In fact, there have even been some proprietary things
creeping in, such as proprietary redefinitions of MIDI status bytes used
by multiple bus parallel and serial computer MIDI interfaces. Things
often work in cycles though, so as musicians and manufacturers persue
proprietary, solo endeavors and ultimately discover the perils of not
persuing standards, then things may swing back the other way, and we may
eventually see some problems with MIDI solved in a universal way (such
as the fact that a single MIDI bus is limited to 16 channels -- too few
to accomodate the newer "multi-timbral" synths that weren't around when
MIDI was originally conceived, and also the slow-by-today's-standards
32K serial baud rate of MIDI).
