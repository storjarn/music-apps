<HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Miscellaneous</H2>

<P><A HREF="olddays.htm">The historical, musical significance of computers</A>
<BR>Often, college instructors assign meaningless "make-work" assignments that have absolutely nothing to do with the
creation or appreciation of art. (That's because art isn't properly taught by The Education Business. Misguided
bureaucrats tend to teach it as if it were a "soft science" in order to more easily categorize and grade art, and thereby
have some simple criteria for issuing/selling pieces of paper known as "degrees"). Often, I get email from unfortunate
victims of The Education Business, who have been assigned the task of writing an essay on "the significance/importance
of computers and MIDI upon music" or "how technology has made things better/easier for musicians". This article is my
response.

<P><A HREF="history.htm">The beginnings of MIDI</A>
<BR>An article that discusses how MIDI came about. This is meant to provide some historical information/perspective
for students needing to write more of the "make-work" assignments.
