Welcome to <B>The World's Most Obnoxious FAQ</B> written by Jeff
Glatt (ie, a really obnoxious guy with a grating sense of humor).
This FAQ addresses what I consider to be the most annoying,
frivolous, and ignorant questions all too frequently asked
in the MIDI and sound card newsgroups, and gives the answers that
I'd <B>really</B> like to give (except that I don't dare because
then people would hate me even more than they already do as a
result of things that I <B>do</B> say).<HR>

<P><H3>What's the difference between an AWE32 and SB32?</H3></P>
<P>The amount of money that Creative Labs has gotten you to spend
for a really crummy audio card.</P>

<P><H3>Does anyone know of a program that converts WAVE files to MIDI?</H3></P>
<P>There has been only one such program ever written. It only runs on the
Commodore C-64. I believe that it was made by IBM. Call and ask them if they
plan to port it to the PC.</P>

<P><H3>Which platform is better for music; the IBM PC or the Macintosh?</H3></P>
<P>Both have their points. The PC clone is good for setting jumpers on your
sound cards, and the Mac is good for crashing your music software.</P>

<P><H3>How can I get rid of the hiss on my Creative Labs Sound Blaster?</H3></P>
<P>Buy a discontent rattlesnake and keep it next to the computer. You'll no
longer hear the sound card's hiss.</P>

<P><H3>What do I have to do to play MIDI files that I downloaded from the
internet? My MIDI player doesn't seem to recognize them.</H3></P>
<P>MIDI files are stored in a special, <B>self-extracting</B> format which
takes a long time to "hatch". Just leave the files alone until they do,
and you'll suddenly hear music coming from your sound card.</P>

<P><H3>What's the best [insert any type of product here -- "sequencer",
"sound card", "operating system", etc]?</H3></P>
<P>The one that will be coming out real soon now.</P>

<P><H3>Why can't I get any of my music programs to work?</H3></P>
<P>Because you're hopelessly stupid.</P>

<P><H3>Why can't I hear anything from my sound card?</H3></P>
<P>You've gone deaf. But, at least it's not as bad as being hopelessly stupid.</P>

<P><H3>How can I play MIDI files, made on a PC clone, on my Mac?</H3></P>
<P>You can't. You have to buy a PC clone. The Mac won't let you readily
do things that should be exceedingly simple to do, such as the above.</P>

<P><H3>I want to buy a MIDI music studio this weekend, but I'm a total
newbie when it comes to MIDI. I don't have any knowledge of what products
are being offered, and I'm not sure what I want. What should I buy?</H3></P>
<P>A very large bottle of aspirin, and an extended warranty.</P>

<P><H3>Help! I need to buy a MIDI. Where do I get one?</H3></P>
<P>There's only one place where a person such as yourself can get as
much help as you apparently need. Dial 911.</P>
