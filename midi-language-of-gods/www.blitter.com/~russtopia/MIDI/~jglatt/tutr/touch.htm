Some people ask "What's the difference between channel and key pressure?".

<P>A keyboard that offers "Channel Pressure" (also known as "Polyphonic
Pressure", or "Polyphonic Aftertouch", or just "Pressure", or some
other epitath that certain manufacturers think makes more sense to
the consumer than the MIDI Spec's official epitath of "Channel
Pressure") means that the piano keyboard has pressure sensitivity
that is an average of all of the keys that you're currently holding
down. In other words, you don't have individual control of each key
being held down. For example, let's say that you play a C triad
(ie, in root position, that's C, E, and G notes played together).
Now, let's also assume that you have your keyboard's pressure tied
to the VCF (ie, Voltage Controlled Filter) filter cutoff, such that
as press down harder on the keys, the "sound" gets "brighter", and
as you ease up the pressure, the "sound" gets "more muffled". Now,
as you're holding down those keys, you apply a little more pressure
to the E key (ie, with that one finger holding down the E key). You
don't increase your pressure on the other two keys (ie, other two
fingers). What is the result with Channel Pressure? All 3 keys get
a little brighter. Now let's say that you ease up the pressure on
the G key. What's the result with Channel Pressure? All 3 keys get
a little more muffled. With Channel Pressure, what you do to one
key affects all sounding keys. (Of course, what the effect is
depends upon what you've set Channel Pressure to affect. But, the
important point to note is that Channel Pressure applies the effect
to all sounding keys equally, and there is no individual control for
each key being held down).</P>

<P>Now, let's contrast that with "Key Pressure" (also known as
"Polyphonic Pressure", or "Polyphonic Aftertouch", or just
"Aftertouch"). A keyboard that offers this feature typically has
many (ie, more than just one) pressure sensor on its piano keyboard.
It usually has a sensor for each key. As you might guess, this
translates to a bigger manufacturing cost, and so cheaper keyboards
typically don't offer "Key Pressure". Because cheaper keyboards
(which represent the majority of instruments purchased) don't
implement Key Pressure, lots of manufacturers don't build sound
modules that recognize it. (After all, what's the point of recognizing
something that will never be sent to the sound module by the majority of
instruments that will control it)? Let's take the above example of
playing a C triad, but this time we use Key Pressure instead of
Channel Pressure to control the VCF cutoff. As you're holding down
the C triad, you apply a little more pressure to the E key (ie, with
that one finger holding down the E key). You don't increase your
pressure on the other two keys (ie, other two fingers). What is the
result with Key Pressure? Only the E key gets a little brighter. The
sound being made by the C and G keys doesn't get any brighter.
Now let's say that you ease up the pressure on the G key. What's the
result with Key Pressure? Only the G key get a little more muffled.
The sound being made by the C and E keys is unaffected. With Key
Pressure, what you do to one key only affects that one key. The
sound of the other keys is not affected.</P>

<P>What's the advantage of Key Pressure? Well, say that you're
playing a string quartet arrangement (ie, playing all 4 instruments'
lines simultaneously). At one point, while all 4 instruments are
sustaining notes, you want to make the cello's note get a little
brighter. With Key Pressure, you can zero in on that one note
without also making the other instruments' notes brighter. That
makes for a realistic imitation of a real string quartet, because
the real instruments <U>would</U> have individual control over their tone
and volume. With Key Pressure, a keyboard player has individual
control over each one of the keys, and can therefore play ensemble
arrangements more realistically (without having to try to remap
portions of the keyboard to different channels, and restrict his
playing to such).</P>

<P>So, can you buy a keyboard controller that offers Key Pressure,
and instantly be able to use that feature with your sound module?
No. Your sound module has to be designed to recognize (and be able
to do something with) Key Pressure. It definitely would be a waste
of money to buy a keyboard controller that generates Key Pressure if
you never get a sound module that utilizes such.</P>

<P>Incidentally, it's possible for a keyboard to offer both Channel
and Key Pressure, and even generate MIDI messages for both
simultaneously. Almost all keyboards that offer Key Pressure also
offer Channel Pressure, but I've never seen an example of the
opposite. Cheap keyboards that represent themselves as "touch
sensitive" (ie, Casio junk) refer to Channel Pressure (and sometimes
the keyboards don't even generate MIDI messages for such -- they
just use it for their internal "voices". Check that MIDI
Implementation Chart!).</P>

<P>Now, finally getting around to answering your question (I'll
bet you thought that I'd never get there -- never ask a question of
someone who has ever been a teacher if you want a quick answer),
what's the best way to find out if your sound module does something
with Key Pressure? Well, all modern equipment (from manufacturers
who know something about MIDI) includes a paper called a "MIDI
Implementation Chart". (Never buy any music equipment from
a manufacturer that doesn't have designers who understand MIDI.
You'll regret it if you do. Lack of a MIDI Implementation Chart is a
good sign that you're dealing with such a manufacturer). Look for
that chart. It should be somewhere in the manuals that come with the
unit, usually at the end of the manual.</P>

<P>There are 4 columns in the chart. At the top of the chart,
you'll note that the middle 2 columns are labeled "Transmitted" and
"Recognized". The "Recognized" column is the one that you want to
look down for a sound module. Run your finger down that column until
you come to the box that is in the same row as the row labeled
"AfterTouch". (The labels for the rows are on the far left side of
the chart). There should be 2 letters in this box. The first letter
will be an X or an O. If this first letter is an X, then your sound
module can't do anything with Key Pressure. Don't bother buying a
keyboard controller with that feature. On the other hand, if the
first letter is an O, then your sound module <U>can</U> do something with
Key Pressure. (For exactly what you can do with Key Pressure, check
to see if there are any REMARKS in the box to the right. If not,
you'll have to look in another section of the manual that gives more
detailed info about the unit's MIDI implementation. Look for Key
Pressure).</P>

<P>The second letter will also be an X or an O. If this second
letter is an X, then your sound module can't do anything with
Channel Pressure. Don't bother buying a keyboard controller with
that feature. On the other hand, if the second letter is an O, then
your sound module <U>can</U> do something with Channel Pressure. (For
exactly what you can do with Channel Pressure, check to see if there
are any REMARKS in the box to the right. If not, you'll have to look
in another section of the manual that gives more detailed info about
the unit's MIDI implementation. Look for Channel Pressure).</P>

<P>Now, when you want to check whether a keyboard controller can
generate Key Pressure, you're going to use the "Transmitted" column
instead of the "Recognized" column. From there, follow the same
instructions as above.</P>
