Before proceeding with this article, you may want to read my article on
<A HREF="rolarc.htm">The architecture of Roland Sound Modules</A>. It has a general overview of the design
of typical Roland Sound Modules.

<P>In the typical Roland user's manual, there is a chapter entitled <B>MIDI Implementation</B>. This chapter
lists the details of how the unit responds to MIDI messages sent to it, as well as what MIDI messages
the unit is capable of generating (if any) and sending to some other MIDI device (such as a sequencer).</P>

<P>I'm now going to walk you through the MIDI Implementation chapter of the Roland JV-90, to show you how to
interpret a typical Roland MIDI Implementation chapter. The JV-90 has a built-in multi-timbral sound module
which is capable of responding to many different MIDI messages. It also has a keyboard which is capable of
generating many different kinds of MIDI messages (to its built-in sound module or other MIDI units).
Many Roland sound modules share somewhat similiar
architectures, and Roland tends to use the same syntax in its user manuals, so this exercise is applicable to
many Roland sound modules. Although the Roland remarks and MIDI particulars I'll be showing you here are specific
to the JV-90, you'll likely find many similiarities to the MIDI Implementation chapter in the manual for other
Roland modules.</P>

<P>I'll be showing you exactly what is printed in the manual, and then adding my own comments immediately to the left
of each line that I've taken from the manual. My comments will have a different color background than the line from
the manual. Here's a typical example:</P>

<TABLE NOBORDER WIDTH=100%>
<TR><TD WIDTH=50% BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">The exact line in the manual:</TD><TD WIDTH=50% BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">My comment about this line:</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH=50%><B>Control Change</B></TD><TD WIDTH=50% BGCOLOR="#99CCCC">This indicates the start of the sub-section where all of the MIDI controllers are listed.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The MIDI Implementation chapter is divided into 4 main sections.</P>

<P>The first main section is entitled <A HREF="rolmidi.htm#rec">RECEIVE DATA</A>. This is the section that tells
what MIDI messages your unit
can understand being sent to it by another device, and what it can do with each of those received messages.
(ie, This section lists what MIDI messages it can receive and do something with).</P>

<P>The second main section is entitled <A HREF="rolmidi.htm#tran">TRANSMIT DATA</A>. This lists all of the MIDI
messages that your unit
is capable of generating when you operate it. (ie, It lists all of the MIDI messages that your unit can create
and send to other MIDI units). Upon Roland sound modules that can't function as a controller of
other devices, or which have no capability to dump their settings to another device, there may be no
TRANSMIT DATA section. (ie, The sound module has no capability to generate MIDI messages on its own).</P>

<P>Each of these main sections is divided into subsections, where each subsection is dedicated to a type of
MIDI message, starting with "Note Off" type of MIDI messages, and going all of the way to "System Exclusive"
(and sometimes "System Realtime" messages such as MIDI Start, Stop, and Clock if the unit has some sort of
onboard sequencer or arpeggiator). For example, the first subsection will most likely be entitled "Note Off",
and it will list information about what your unit does when it receives or transmits Note Off messages.</P>

<P>Incidentally, an "H" appended to some numeric value means that it is expressed as hexadecimal, not a decimal,
number. For example, 7FH means 7F hexadecimal, which is 127 decimal. Use your Windows calculator in scientific mode to
easily enter hex values and convert them to decimal, and vice versa).</P>

<P>The third and fourth main sections are dedicated to giving the excruciating details of the JV-90's System Exclusive
data dumps. The JV-90 can dump all of its patch, performance, effects, etc, settings over MIDI using System Exclusive
messages. Those settings can then be saved
upon some storage device. The JV-90 can also accept such a dump to restore its settings to those previously saved values.
In fact, every single parameter on the JV-90 which can be changed manually by you from the JV-90's front panel can also
be changed over MIDI by sending a System Exclusive message to the JV-90. This System Exclusive message will contain
info that tells what parameter to change, and what its new value should be.</P>

Another comment about how the JV-90 handles Bank Select messages it receives. All this is saying is that if you go into
the "System Common" settings of the JV-90, there's a setting called "Program bank sel". If you set this to off, then the
JV-90 ignores Bank Select messages it receives.</TD></TR>

If you're in patch mode, and the JV-90 receives a Bank Select, it will use this (in conjunction with a following Program
Change message) to select a new patch that the keyboard plays. If you're in Performance mode, and the JV-90 receives a Bank
Select, what happens depends upon whether you have the Control Channel enabled and then whether the Bank Select is
transmitted on that channel. If so, then the Bank Select is used to change to another Performance among several Banks
of Performances. Otherwise, the Bank Select is used to change the patch assigned to one of the Parts in the currently
selected Performance. Which part? Well, the part that is assigned to the same MIDI channel as the Bank Select message was
sent upon.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH=49%>The bank number specified as follow.</TD><TD WIDTH=50% BGCOLOR="#99CCCC">
This is just telling you that below this is now a chart that shows you what specific coarse and fine bank numbers to use,
in conjunction with what Program Change numbers, to select specific patches in certain components upon the JV-90. For
example, what Bank Select fine and coarse numbers do you use, and what Program Change number do you use, to select the
first patch in the "Preset B" bank? According to the chart below, that would be a coarse bank number of 81, a fine bank
number of 1, and a Program Change number of 65. The article <A HREF="bank.htm">Changing patches over MIDI using Bank
Select Controller</A> has a more indepth explanation and example using the below JV-90 Patch chart. The JV-90's use of
Bank Select controller is similiar to other Roland Sound Modules, and may help you in understanding how to utilize your
own manual's Patch chart.</TD></TR>

Pretty self-explanatory. In patch mode, Program Change changes to another patch. In performance play mode, each Part has its own patch assignment.

This is a comment about the other jacks and levers upon the JV-90. All this is saying is that they aren't hardwired to
a particular controller number (like the Mod lever and Hold pedal jack are). So, you can change the function that these
control. For example, you can take the C1 lever and assign it to controller number 07. That's the controller for Volume.
So when you move the C1 lever, it generates MIDI Volume controller messages (and can therefore change the volume of the
patch that the keyboard is playing). Or, you can assign the C1 lever to controller number 0A. That's the controller for
Pan. So when you move the C1 lever, it now generates MIDI Pan controller messages instead (and can therefore change the
pan position of the patch that the keyboard is playing). You can assign the C1 lever to any controller number in the range
0 to 95. See the chart <A HREF="ctl.htm">Defined MIDI controllers</A> for a list of all of the defined controller
numbers, and what they control. (But note that the JV-90's built-in module responds only to a few of the defined
controllers -- only those that were listed under "Control change" in the RECEIVE DATA section. So too, the Pedal 1 and
Pedal 2 jacks can be assigned to any of those controller numbers. But note that the Pedal 1 jack can only set a controller
to either the value 0 (ie, the pedal is released) or 127 (ie, the pedal is pressed down). Unlike the C1 lever or Pedal 2
jack, the Pedal 1 jack can't generate values inbetween 0 and 127.</TD></TR>
