Cheap audio (ie. game) cards are not well known for their ability to reject picking up
high frequency interference from nearby components. You may want to reposition 
your cards in their ISA slots to determine if this noise is related to a card 
next to the sound card. In particular, keep the sound card away from the video 
or HD controller cards. If possible, leave the two ISA slots next to the sound 
card empty.

<P>You may even want to consider constructing some extra shielding around the
sound card. What you do is get 2 thin pieces of copper or aluminum sheeting 
approximately equal to the width/height of your sound card. Glue a thin piece 
of cardboard (ie, cut up a shoe box) to each side of each metal sheet. (ie, You
want to sort of encase each metal sheet in cardboard so that it doesn't make 
direct contact with any nearby components, including on the sound card). Place 
these 2 shields around the sound card (ie, one on each side). Connect an 
insulated wire from each shield to the chassis ground. Furthermore, you should 
make sure that your audio amp is plugged into the same grounded outlet as 
you're using for the computer. Also, use shielded audio cables to connect your 
card's audio outputs to the amp, to avoid picking up any noise from the ISA 
backplate connector (which touches all of the cards in your ISA bus, and could
possibly transmit noise between them. But hopefully, your card uses some sort
of molded, plastic insulation around the output jack itself, so insulated 
cables are just an extra, probably unnecessary precaution).</P>

<P>But I doubt that any of the above will help you if the noise problem is a 
result of the sound card's own generated noise from using parts with low Signal
To Noise ratios. You can't make the components do more than they're designed to
do. The above shielding will only eliminate noise that isn't supposed to be
inherent in the card's design (ie, noise resulting from interference with other
cards). The shielding won't make poor components on your card perform better
than their design allows.</P>

<P>The biggest source of noise in cards is a poor analog output stage and/or
poor analog input stage. When you're not using the Line Input on your card, turn
the volume all of the way down. Also, use the Line Output of the card and run it
to your own powered speakers or amplifier. Avoid using the Speaker Output on the
card.</P></BODY></HTML>
