Most sequencers time-stamp MIDI data in terms of "clock pulses". For
example, a sequencer may have a clock resolution of 96 pulses per quarter
note. This means that 96 clock pulses are counted off for the duration of
each quarter note (ie, a quarter note is held for 96 pulses). Because an
eighth note is half as long as a quarter note, this means that an eighth
note is held for 48 clock pulses. Since a half note is twice as long as
a quarter note, the half note is held for 192 clock pulses.

<P>The charts below show how many clock pulses are in each note value for
various PPQN (pulses per quarter note) resolutions. For example, the first
chart is used if your sequencer has a 96 PPQN clock resolution. Note values
start with a whole note and diminish down to a 128th note. (Some PPQN
resolution do not divide evenly to support certain note values. An
unsupported note value is indicated by <B>--</B>).</P>
