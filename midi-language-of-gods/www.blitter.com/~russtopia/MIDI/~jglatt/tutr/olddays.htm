<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>The historical significance of computers/MIDI</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR=FFFFFF TEXT=000000>

I still remember back in the old days before computers and MIDI
became the useful musical tools that they are now, and I
<B>definitely</B> don't want to go back to those days.

<P>Before the days of MIDI sequencers, and keyboards with
realistic-sounding samples of instruments, in order to even hear what
one of my arrangements sounded like, I had to assemble all of the
musicians required to perform the piece, and get them to play it for me.
If I didn't have access to a multi-track tape recorder, and a mixing
console, etc, that meant that I had to get them all together
simultaneously to play the piece live in order to hear the full
arrangement. If one of them couldn't show up at a scheduled time (and
musicians are notorious for not being able to stick to a schedule), then
it was tough luck for me. I had to wait until the guy finally got around
to playing his part so that I could actually hear what my arrangment
<B>really</B> sounded like. In the meantime, I had to twiddle my thumbs.
And how else can a composer know if his arrangement is what he wants
until he hears it? Of course, if I decided to rewrite the parts after
hearing the arrangement actually played, that meant that I had to
reassemble the musicians again at a later date to hear the new
arrangement (and usually, they don't want to have to redo something
unless you're paying them, which can be expensive, especially if you
need to "motivate" them with cocaine).

<P><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>MIDI/computers make it possible for a composer to hear
his arrangement played without needing other musicians. It thereby frees
the composer from scheduling problems, and allows him more opportunity
to audition his composition during the composition process, which provides
invaluable feedback to aid in composition.</B></FONT>

<P>I've <B>still</B> got a stack of arrangements sitting around from
years back which I've never even heard because I can't find the
musicians to play the scores. The music I write often requires some
difficult technique. You know how hard it is to find musicians who can
play this stuff in a small town like the one in which I live? Almost
impossible. And that's assuming that the musicians in this area even
<B>want</B> to play the music I've written. I write "progressive rock"
which is not all that popular music. Most musicians prefer to play music
they like, and that would be "popular music". I don't write pop music.
So it's doubly hard for me to find musicians since I write
difficult-to-play, esoteric music.

<P><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>MIDI/computers made it easier for composers to hear
difficult-to-execute, or esoteric, music. It is often easier to have a
computer play a difficult performance than it is to find a musician
capable of playing that performance. Likewise, it is often easier to
have a computer play esoteric music (ie, unusual instrumentation) than
find musicians who have appropriate skills and the desire to play that
music.</B></FONT>

<P>And even if you could get all of the musicians, the time it took to do a
multi-track recording on the old analog equipment, what with setting up
microphones, running cables, rewinding the tape, etc, takes <B>so</B> much
longer then pressing the record button on an electronic keyboard with a
built-in sequencer and its own samples of instruments, and immediately
playing your part. You write a long piece (such as my 8 minute long
"Joan of Arc" arrangment on my web site) and you can spend minutes just
waiting for the tape to rewind to hear just one of what will likely be
hundreds of "takes" to build up the parts. And don't forget that with
analog tape, you can't zero on an individual musical event and "correct"
the wrong note just by entering the "correct" MIDI digital value like
you can with a sequencer. If you make a mistake, you have erase over it,
and literally play it again. To save time, we did "punch ins" (ie,
recording over the area on the tape only where the mistake occurs), but
this is hard to do. If the guy pressing the record button didn't happen
to press it at just the perfect moment (ie, we didn't have a computer to
automatically punch in at a certain time -- we had to do it manually --
so the musician playing the overdub always needed someone else around to
press buttons), you could miss the attack on a note, or destroy the
release on a previously recorded note that you didn't want to record
over. And if you blew it, then you had to back up the tape and punch in
earlier (ie, each time you made a mistake, you had to start earlier in
the piece, forcing you to replay sections that were good, thus perhaps
introducing a mistake in those section). Suffice it to say, that
punch-ins and redoing takes, and trying to get rid of mistakes on analog
tape is <B>much, much</B> more difficult and time-consuming than with a MIDI
sequencer. And wasting time correcting mistakes means that you have less
time to do more productive things.

<P>And don't forget that with analog tape, you can't slow it down, record
your part at a slower tempo (so that it's easier to play), and then
speed the tape up for playback. If you do that, it changes the quality
of the sound (ie, changes the overtones, vibrato speed, tremulo speed,
etc). You end up with a "Mickey Mouse" effect.

<P>Oh, and if you need to change the key (ie, transpose the parts) after you
recorded all of the parts, because the singer has trouble hitting the
"high notes"? Too bad. Start all over again from the beginning.

<P>Let me tell you, the first thing I did when I switched to using MIDI to
play my arrangements was <B>throw away my analog, multi-track reel-to-reel
tape recorder.</B> Good riddance!

<P><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>MIDI/computers allow for more efficient recording
sessions by streamlining/improving the process of correcting mistakes in
the recording, and streamlining the recording process itself. MIDI/computers
also eliminate the need to have an engineer with special skills, as the
computer takes over some of those functions, such as "punching in"
overdubs. MIDI/computers also offer efficient ways to make useful
changes, such as transposing key.</B></FONT>

<P>And if you wanted a really professional sounding recording of your music,
you had to either buy really expensive recording equipment, or you had
to rent time in expensive recording studios. Remember that back in the
old days, we didn't have ICs with really dense circuitry. Manufacturers
had to use a lot more electronics to deliver less. I bought a Prophet 5
synthesisor. It had analog, basic waveforms that could maybe produce
somewhat tolerable renditions of real instruments. It cost me $5,500 for
that one synth. Today, you can get better sound than that synth out of a
$100 computer audio card. I'm not kidding you. I was there. Trying to get a
good sax sound out of that synth, for example, took <B>days</B> of programming
it (ie, some of the early synths didn't even have programmable,
battery-backed memory so you lost all of your settings every time you
turned it off), and then you'd get something that wasn't even <B>nearly</B> as
realistic sounding as what you can get in a cheap (couple of hundred
dollars), modern instrument with digital sampling (ie, the technology
used on today's computer sound cards).

<P>And the price of going into a recording studio? We're talking <B>hundreds
of dollars an hour</B>. You could go broke before the microphones were even
setup in front of all of the instruments. You want to know how they got
the drum sounds that you hear out of your basic sound card? They had to
individually tune each drumhead, and dampen its overtones (toilet paper
taped to the drum head in certain spots worked great -- I was a
recording engineer years ago, in case you're wondering). It typically
took a minimum of 2 hours to tune an entire kit, just to get the sounds
that you can get out of a digital sampler today within seconds of
turning it on. And you had to <B>pay</B> for that 2 hours of time. And don't
forget the musicians' salaries who are playing for your session.

<P><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN>MIDI/computers allow for professional recordings to be
made on a budget, in small, "home" environments that don't require
things like special soundproofing. Furthermore, the technology in
computer audio often eliminates expensive, time-consuming tasks, such as
tuning drumkits and placing microphones/cables. The storage capacity of
computers also makes recalling a given setup very efficient and
inexpensive, which is important since often a setup needs to be
recalled during multiple sessions.</B></FONT>

<P>Now contrast this with MIDI (ie, computer sequencers using MIDI, and
computer sound cards with the ability to play numerous musical parts
with realistic-sounding instruments). With MIDI, I can play all of the
musical parts myself. (Well, really the MIDI sequencer is my "band". It
obeys all of my instructions, whenever I want, even when I get a great
musical idea at 3AM. Try assembling a band at 3AM in order to check out
a musical idea. Good luck. With MIDI, I plug in my headphones, and start
arranging my great idea immediately, and my sleeping neighbors don't
even know that I'm arranging <B>and listening to the playback</B> of my musical
piece written for a 40 piece orchestra).

<P>With a MIDI sequencer, you press the rewind button and it's
instantaneously ready for playback. No waiting for rewinding tape. You
can have the sequencer automatically punch-in for you. (ie, You don't
need another guy to punch the record button while you're busy playing
your overdub). You can fix your mistakes just by quickly editing the
individual "musical events". Most sequencers can display the data in the
representation of a musical manuscript upon the computer's display. You
just click on the graphical notes with the computer "mouse" to edit
them. There's no equivalent to that in the old analog days.

<P>And you can slow down the tempo to record your part. Speed it up for
playback, and no Mickey Mouse effect.

<P>And transposing? The computer does it for me. I just tell it how many
half steps up or down, or tell it what new key signature to use.

<P>And it's helped improve my arranging immensely. For one thing, I get
instantaneous feedback on my arrangements <B>while</B> I'm arranging, just by
pressing the play button on the sequencer. I don't have to wait for
musicians to play my parts. (And I don't have to pay them either because
"them" is my multi-timbral MIDI module playing all of their parts on all
of their instruments. For the price of hiring musicians for one
recording session, I've purchased equipment that I can use for hundreds
of sessions). And I can play instruments myself that I never could play
before. I can play the violin. I can play the flute. I can play the
trumpet. I can play the timpani. I can play an elkherders' moohoo horn.
How? Because I've got a keyboard that has realistic-sounding renditions
of all of those instruments. (Well, not the moohoo horn. It's hard to
find a good moohoo horn sample). And, I can play <B>that</B>. It really helps
to get a feel for how to use an instrument in an arrangement when you
actually get to "play" it yourself, listening to how it sounds in
various ranges (ie, good samplers use multiple samples to adequately
reproduce the character of the instrument across its note range) and
hearing how it blends in with other instruments in an arrangement.

<P>I'm finally getting to hear some of those old arrangements, because now
I've stopped waiting for Rich or Mike to play my guitar solo (which both
said that he would do years ago but never got around to learning and
recording the part. Damn those useless guitar players! I say, we keyboard
players should strive to make them obsolete as we did with drummers, violinists,
etc. After all, it's musical darwinism, so it can't be stopped. The weaker
string strummers and skin beaters were destined to be replaced by the stronger
ivory ticklers). I'm playing it myself using MIDI and a good sampler
with a guitar sound. And my MIDI module never complains about what I'm
forcing it to play. It never says "Hey, I don't like this esoteric,
weird-sounding music you write, and I don't want to play it". MIDI has
been a boon to musicians who write esoteric music. Check out Frank
Zappa's Civilization Phase III, done entirely on a synclavier (ie,
really fancy digital sampler with built-in sequencer). I doubt you could
find many musicians who could play that music, and probably none who
could duplicate those highly-electronically-processed sounds with
traditional instruments (even though he is manipulating samples of those
traditional instruments).

<P>With MIDI, I make recordings that sound like they were done in an
expensive professional recording studio, and I do it in my home at a
fraction of the cost and time and physical space. I wish I had it all
<B>years</B> ago.

<P>By the way, did I mention that I used to have to walk 5 miles to school everyday
through 10 foot high ridges of freezing snow (when I was a four foot tall
kid)? You young "MIDI kids" of today have it <B>easy</B>... (Hey, I had to listen
to that crap from adults when I was a kid. Now it's <B>your</B> turn).
