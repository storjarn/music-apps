<P>The RAP-10 is essentially the SCC-1's MIDI Synth (first
128 patches only, like the SCD-10) with 2 tracks of
CD-quality digital audio added. As such, it sports the
much-acclaimed Roland Sound Canvas waveform set as found
in cards like the SCC-1, SCD-10, SCD-15, and SC-7 (but
not the newer Sound Canvasses such as the SC-88, which
have newer waveform sets and improved playback
circuitry). The RAP-10 does not support replacing any of
its GM waveforms.

<P>The RAP-10 has a digital reverb (with choices of various
rooms or halls, decay time, and level) which can
alternately be used as a delay (with repeats and delay
time adjustable). Furthermore, the RAP-10 has a chorus
(with feedback, delay, rate and depth). These effects
can be applied both to the MIDI Synth Parts as well as
digital audio (with separate reverb/delay and chorus
levels for each Part and each of the two tracks).</P>

<P>In fact, the RAP-10's digital audio tracks each have a
number of settings including tuning (in both half steps
and cents), panning, reverb level, chorus level, volume,
brightness, and sample rate. For playback, these can be
adjusted via System Exclusive messages (ie, so any
software that supports System Exclusive can be used to
adjust all of these parameters) even during digital audio
playback. In essense, the RAP-10 allows a lot of the
realtime control over digital audio tracks that it allows
for one of its GM MIDI Synth Parts (but by using SysEx
instead of Controller messages).</P>

<P>The MIDI Synth Parts understand and respond to Channel
Pressure (which can be used to control Brightness,
Volume, Vibrato Depth, and/or Vibrato Rate, with each
Part responding to Pressure in any or no combination of
the above ways, independently of other Parts), Modulation
(which can be used to control Vibrato Speed and/or
Depth), Volume Controller, Effect1 Controller (ie, reverb
level), Effect3 Controller (ie, chorus level), Hold Pedal
Controller, Expression Controller, Pan Controller, Pitch
Bend, Program Change, Reset All Controllers, All Sounds
Off, and All Notes Off.</P>

<P>Furthermore, using Registered Parameter Number
Controller, each Part's Pitch Bend Range, as well as
tuning (in half steps and cents) can be controlled. Using
Non-registered Parameter Number Controller, you can
control the pan, volume, tuning, chorus level, and reverb
level for each drum sound in a kit (in addition to being
able to control the entire kit's overall volume, pan,
chorus level, and reverb level).</P>

<P>The RAP-10 has a master Volume and master tuning (ie, for
all 16 Parts and 2 digital audio tracks) in both half
steps and cents.</P>

<P>The RAP-10 ships with a Windows MCI driver that will
work under Win95, and also some software that graphically
mimics a multi-track mixer for recording/playback. The
bundled program is more geared for hobbyist and
multi-media work than pro musician's use. The RAP-10 can
be used with pro software such as CakeWalk, SAW, Sound
Forge, or other Windows titles, utilizing both its MIDI
Synth and digital audio simultaneously. You can also use
OS/2's RTMIDI MPU-401 driver, but this will not enable
digital audio tracks (ie, GM sound module control only).
(You could even use Win95's MPU-401 driver, but this also
won't enable digital audio tracks).</P>

<P>In order to obtain the actual MIDI In/Out/Thru jacks, you
need to attach a "breakout box" to the joystick port. The
joystick port is compatible with the Sound Blaster, so
any breakout box for the SB will suffice (ie, you don't
need the overpriced MCB-10).</P>

<P>The SC-7 is essentially the SCC-1's MIDI Synth (first
128 patches only, like the SCD-10) in an external box
that attaches to the computer's serial port. (It can
attach to both the IBM and Mac serial ports, and
instructions are given on using the SC-7 with either.
This is a cheap way for Mac owners to get a nice, low
cost Roland GM sound module). As such, it sports the
much-acclaimed Roland Sound Canvas waveform set as found
in cards like the SCC-1, SCD-10, SCD-15, and RAP-10 (but
not the newer Sound Canvasses such as the SC-88, which
have newer waveform sets and improved playback
circuitry). The SC-7 does not support replacing any of
its GM waveforms, nor does it record/play digital audio.

<P>See the RAP-10 description for remarks about the SC-7's
MIDI Synth engine. It's the same as the RAP-10's, so all
RAP-10 remarks (except as concern digital audio tracks)
are pertinent (ie, its effects and support for MIDI
messages is the same).</P>

<P>The SC-7 is a complete, standalone unit. It can be used
without the computer. It has its own power supply and
case. An external keyboard (or other MIDI controller) can
be plugged directly into the SC-7 MIDI In to play it as
a 16-Part multi-timbral module.</P>

<P>The SC-7 ships with a Windows MCI driver, and also some
software (Ballade, a sequencer, and Band in a Box). It
can be used with pro sequencers such as CakeWalk.</P>

<P>Furthermore, because the SC-7 offers MIDI In and Out
jacks to which you can attach even more MIDI gear, it
becomes a MIDI interface between your computer and all
other external gear. This makes the SC-7 nice for laptop
use since it allows connecting external MIDI gear via a
clone or Mac serial port, is a 16-part multi-timbral unit
also, and can even be used without the computer. It's
very small, light, and therefore portable.</P>

<P>The SCC-1 is a MIDI Synth only (ie, no digital audio,
ie, WAVE recording/playback). It sports the
much-acclaimed Roland Sound Canvas waveform set as found
in cards like the RAP-10, SCD-10, SCD-15, and SC-7 (but
not the newer Sound Canvasses such as the SC-88, which
have newer waveform sets and improved playback
circuitry). The SCC-1 does not support replacing any of
its GS waveforms.

<P>See the RAP-10 description for remarks about the SCC-1's
MIDI Synth engine. It's the same as the RAP-10's (with
extra patches and drum kits, plus recognition of Bank
Select Controller to select such), so all RAP-10 remarks
(except as concern digital audio tracks) are pertinent
(ie, its effects and support for MIDI messages is the
same). The SCC-1's Parts do have a few extra parameters
that can be adjusted, which the RAP-10 and SC-7 do not
have, such as Attack Time and Filter Resonance.</P>

<P>Early SCC-1 units had less than 354 patches (ie, didn't have
the extra MT-32 sounds). The only difference between new
SCC-1 units and the SCC-1B appears to be that the latter
includes bundled software, such as a nice patch editor (ie,
although you can't change the GM waveforms used in a patch,
you can adjust VCA and VCF envelopes to contour the sound.
This is different than the RAP-10 or SC-7 more hard-wired GM
Patch sets). The SCC-1 also offers MT-32 sounds (but not
without some of the patch customization that the MT-32
offered). MT-32 sounds are mediocre by today's audio
standards, but some older games were designed to support
MT-32 rather than GM.</P>

<P>Furthermore, the SCC-1 has a fully intelligent MPU-401
compatibility, so it understands all MPU-401 commands.
(That's not as important today since most software,
especially Windows stuff, no longer uses MPU-401
Intelligent Mode).</P>

<P>The SCC-1 ships with a Windows MCI driver, (and the
SCC-1B with some apps), which will also work under
Windows 95 (but you're better off using Win95's MPU-401
driver instead). It can be used with pro sequencers such
as CakeWalk. You can also use OS/2's RTMIDI MPU-401
driver.</P>

<P>Roland has replaced the SCC-1 with a package containing
the MPU-401/AT and SCD-15 daughterboard. It's essentially
the same thing as an SCC-1B. (I forget what they call this
combo deal).</P>

<P>The SC-88 is an external box that attaches to the
computer's serial port. (It can attach to both the IBM
and Mac serial ports). It contains not only the SCC-1's
waveform set, but also newer waveforms (over 300 more)
and improved playback circuitry (including 18-bit DACs).
It also has many more effects (and reverb and delay are
separate units now, so Reverb, Delay, Chorus, and EQ are
simultaneous). The SC-88 therefore offers a
substantially different and improved MIDI Synth than all
other Roland Sound Canvas cards (except the SC-55mkII).
The SC-88 does not support replacing any of its waveforms,
nor does it record/play digital audio.

<P>The SC-88 is a complete, standalone unit. It can be used
without the computer. It has its own power supply and
case. An external keyboard (or other MIDI controller) can
be plugged directly into the SC-88 MIDI In to play it as
a 16-Part multi-timbral module. A second controller can be
plugged into the second MIDI In to play 16 more
multi-timbral parts. (In order to use all 32 mult-timbral
parts with the computer, you have to have the latest version
of Roland's MIDI serial driver, available from Roland's web
site, under Products/Software updates. This driver turns the serial
port into 2 separate MIDI Outs, each with 16 MIDI channels).</P>

<P>Furthermore, because the SC-88 offers MIDI In and Out
jacks to which you can attach even more MIDI gear, it
becomes a MIDI interface between your computer and all
other external gear. This makes the SC-88 nice for laptop
use since it allows connecting external MIDI gear via a
clone or Mac serial port, is a multi-timbral unit also, and
can even be used without the computer.</P>

<P>The SC-88 does have an LCD panel and knobs, so that its
Patch parameters can be edited from the SC-88 itself (as
opposed to the SC-7 and SC-55 requiring a software
"patch editor" to change various parameters). The SC-88VL
is the same as the SC-88 expect that it doesn't have the
patch editing knobs (ie, like the SC-7 and SC-55, it requires
computer software to change its patch settings).</P>

<P>The SCD-10 is essentially the SCC-1's MIDI Synth (first
128 patches only) in the form of a daughterboard that
attaches to a Sound Blaster's Waveblaster connector. (It
is not a self-contained card). The SCD-10 does not
support replacing any of its GM waveforms, nor does it
record/play digital audio (which is left up to the host card).

<P>See the RAP-10 description for remarks about the SCD-10's
MIDI Synth engine. It's the same as the RAP-10's, so all
RAP-10 remarks (except as concern digital audio tracks)
are pertinent (ie, its effects and support for MIDI
messages is the same).</P>

<P>Unlike self-contained Roland cards such as the SCC-1,
RAP-10, or SC-7, the SCD-10 uses its host's output stage,
which in typical Sound Blaster cards and compatibles, is
not quite as noise and distortion free as Roland cards.</P>

<P>The SCD-10 ships with some strictly hobbyist software
(DoReMi and Easy Juke). It can be used with pro
sequencers such as CakeWalk, provided your host card has
proper driver support.</P>

<P>One real advantage of the SCD-10 (and SCD-15) over other
Roland cards is that, since these cards attach to an SB
compatible host, they offer the best audio solution to a
game player. The RAP-10's digital audio hardware is not
SB compatible, and therefore not supported by game
software (which is typically MS-DOS software that writes
directly to hardware rather than Windows software that
uses MCI drivers). The other Roland cards do not offer
digital audio playback. So they can't be used to play
voice and sound effects in games (which are usually done
with WAVE files. On the other hand, since most game
software can play its background music via an MPU-401
port, all Roland cards can be used to play background
music for those games). The SCD-10, in combo with its
host, offers a complete solution, as the host plays voice
and sound effects, and the SCD-10 with its renowned
Roland waveform set plays the background music, without
requiring two separate sound cards.</P>

<P>The SCD-15 is the same thing as the SCD-10 except that
it has the full set of GS patches (ie, 354 instead of
only 128) plus some MT-32 sounds. It has a few extra drum
kits too. Otherwise, all other remarks concerning the
SCD-10 apply to the SCD-15.

<P>The extra patches are really not of much use to game
players since most game software sticks to the smaller
GM set of patches. A musician seeking a greater variety
of sounds for MIDI file recording/playback may find the
extra GS patches more useful, although the extra MT-32
sounds are mediocre by today's audio standards.</P>

<P>The MPU-401/AT is a MIDI interface card without any
built-in sound module nor digital audio tracks. It is
meant to control external MIDI units as well as any SB
compatible daughterboard plugged into the MPU-401/AT's
internal connector (such as the SCD-10 or SCD-15. In fact,
putting an SCD-15 into an MPU-401/AT gives you essentially
an SCC-1B). But, the MPU-401 itself is not SB compatible
(ie, it accomodates SB daughterboards, but is not an
SB compatible card itself, and therefore will not work with
software requiring SB compatibility).

<P>It offers MPU-401 Intelligent and Uart modes. An
advantage of using this card as the host for an SCD-10 or
SCD-15 is that this card's audio output circuitry is
cleaner and quieter than what is normally found in an SB
type card.</P>

<P>Earlier MPU-401 units did not have the daughterboard
connector. The very first MPU-401 was actually an external
box containing all of the Roland circuitry and MIDI jacks.
This box attached into a secondary card that plugged into
the ISA bus. Later, Roland reduced its chipset size, and
was able to fit everything onto one ISA card that fit into
the computer. This was the MPU-IPC. Recently, Roland added
the daughterboard connector, for the MPU-401/AT. (I
recommend the MPU-401/AT, as there were also some improvements
in MIDI throughput made).</P>

<P>The SCP-55B is essentially the SCC-1's MIDI Synth in the
form of a PCMCIA card that plugs into a PCMCIA slot on
a computer. The SCP-55B does not support replacing any
of its GM waveforms. Unlike the SCC-1, the SCP-55B
incorporates the RAP-10's digital audio capabilities.

<P>See the RAP-10 description for remarks about the SCP-55B's
MIDI Synth engine. It's the same as the SCC-1B's, so all
SCC-1B remarks are pertinent. Furthermore, see the RAP-10
description for remarks about the SCP-55B's digital audio
tracks.</P>

<P>The SCP-55B is ideal for laptop computers with a PCMCIA
slot. The SCP-55B can simultaneously play full MIDI scores
along with 2 tracks of CD-quality audio (recorded/played
to the Hard Drive). Therefore, multi-media presentations
can be made with full background music scores and sound
effects/voice narration happening simultaneously, at very
good sound quality.</P>

<P>The SCP-55B needs the MCB-3 to provide external MIDI
jacks and output/input jacks.</P>

<P>The SCP-55B ships with several Windows titles, including
CakeWalk Express (create/play MIDI files), and Macromedia
Action (a multi-media authoring tool).</P>


<H2>NOTES:</H2>

<P>All cards use Roland's own proprietary chipsets.</P>

<P>One nice thing about the Roland cards which they have over
cheap cards is a hardware buffered MIDI output. This allows
the computer's CPU to typically stream MIDI messages to the
card without requiring the CPU to wait for the card to accept
MIDI bytes. With the RAP-10, this can even happen at the full
bus speed of 8MHz, resulting in a more stable timing for
sequenced playback, especially under CPU-taxing OS's such as
Windows. Other cards typically make the CPU wait until
the card has shifted out a MIDI byte at 32KHz before the
card will accept another byte.</P>

<P>Street prices were obtained from ComputAbility, a typical
computer mail order firm (800-554-9948) during the time when
these products were available new.</P>

<P>The sales/distribution for Roland's line of computer cards
has been taken over by <A HREF="http://www.edirol.com">Editol</A>.
