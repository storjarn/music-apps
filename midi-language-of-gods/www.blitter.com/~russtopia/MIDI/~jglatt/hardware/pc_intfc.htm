This is a schematic for a MIDI Adapter designed to work with the Sound Blaster joystick (ie, game) port. It should also
work with any card having a compatible joystick port.

<H3>Parts</H3>

<PRE>4 resistors. 3 will have values of 220 ohms, and 1 with a value of 2200 ohms
1 Diode (1N4148)
1 74LS00 IC (ie, contains 4 NAND gates)
1 OptoIsolator (CNY17, or a 6N138 or Sharp PC900 may be substituted with
    changes as noted)
2 female DIN jacks (or you can use male DIN plugs if you wish to connect
    directly to the MIDI device without extra MIDI cables)
1 male 15 pin MINI DB connector (to plug into the sound card's gameport)

<P>This circuit is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind either
expressed or implied or tatooed in a place that only a few people have ever
seen, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, and the dubious assumption that the
circuit has been created by a sane individual who would never do anything
that may hurt you. The entire risk as to the results and performance of the
circuit is assumed by you or someone who looks exactly like you. Jeff Glatt
does not guarantee that the operation of this circuit will meet your
requirements, especially if your requirements involve lots of latex and some
docile, domesticated animal. Nor does Jeff Glatt warranty the circuit to be
uninterruptable or error-free, although mercifully free of "Pompous Ass
Copyright Holder" hassles. If you use said circuit, you can not say anything
nasty about the author nor Jeff Glatt, even if the circuit inadvertently
causes the erasure of your collection of X-rated GIFs of a conservative,
overweight and overrated TV "personality" plooking himself vigorously with
his royalty checks from some rancid paperback. Jeff Glatt is not responsible
for any damages as a result of anything that he has done, or hasn't done, or
was supposed to do but never got around to it, and furthermore, he doesn't
even care so leave him alone, sewer mold. You may have more or less
protections in certain states of the union, depending upon how far your local
politician is willing to bend over for some bribe from a business lobbyist.
Just remember that Jeff Glatt has no money, so don't bother suing him as a
result of any damages caused by this circuit. Tell your greasy lawyer to go
after Creative Labs, and make sure that you pick 12 really stupid pinheads
for the jury. If swallowed, induce vomiting immediately by contemplating the
performance of Sound Blaster MIDI.</P>
