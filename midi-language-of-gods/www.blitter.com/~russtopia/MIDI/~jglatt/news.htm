This page lists things that I have added or changed on the specified date. This should make it easier for repeat visitors (ie, folks who haven't yet figured out that there aren't any nude models here, and have gone elsewhere for their cheap thrills) to quickly determine what they haven't seen since their last visit. Just remember the last date that you called this Web Site, and look at any additions or changes after that date. (The date is referenced from Eastern Standard Time).

<P>This Web Site undergoes periodic (ie, whenever the hell I finally get around to it) changes and additions. To keep this page as brief as possible, I'll remove remarks about a particular addition/change after a month since the date it appeared upon this page. In other words, if you check back once a month, you should be informed of all additions/changes. You should also get out of the house more.

<P>On the "MIDI Hardware Projects" page:

<P>Added a new project <A HREF="http://www.borg.com/~jglatt/hardware%5Cpc_keys%5Cadapter.htm">PC keyboard to MIDI note controller adapter</A>, which is a
schematic for building a MIDI Adapter that allows a PC (computer) keyboard to be directly attached to a MIDI sound module to "play" that module (ie, like a controller keyboard). Submitted by Alan Probandt.
